            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>MUch might be said (to save you from fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in this day of <hi>Jacobs</hi> trouble) from the frequent renewed manifestations, both of the fulness, and also the freeness of Gods grace and mercy, fournishing, and fitting the sufferers for his sake, in our Land that no Church hath been more honoured, and helped to give faithfull and free Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, against all stepps of defection since our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from Popery and Prelacy; and that by some of all sorts, Noblemen, Gentlemen, Ministers and
<pb facs="tcp:100855:3"/> Commons; (though alas the generality of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hath made shamefull defection) whose car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riadges, through Gods countenance, was both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, and confounding to foes, and also confirming and conforting to friends, the great token for good in our Land, and that which hath kept the cause alive. But to pass by those that first filled the field, and laid down their lives, when those famous and glorified Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, mentioned in that Book intituled Naphtali, or the wrestlings of the Church of Scotland. The famous <hi>Marcus</hi> of Argyle, Lord <hi>Waristone,</hi> and glorified Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Guthrie</hi> who were as Gideons fleece wett, when all about were drie.

<pb facs="tcp:100855:3"/> Glasgow, where he was imprisoned; in the midst of wrath remembring mercy, after which I having the happiness to be acquainted vvith him, can vvith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence give you this testimony, yet no man vvas like minded in our Land all almost, especially in his station, seeking their ovvn things bot he the things of Jesus Christ; <hi>Caleb</hi> like of a more Heroick spirit, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovving the Lord <hi>Fully</hi> vvhose vvork and labour of love the righteous Lord doth not forget, but his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are reaping the fruits thereof (vvhen riches, honor and pleasure vvere the generality of all our great ons Trinitie vvhom they adored,) his vvork vvas to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: God inrich his soul, and to see Christ formed in the souls of his Children, and houshold persuading them to make God their portion, in all vvhich he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled in soul vvith them, and by the blessing of God it had such success that it remaineth visible amongst his vvorthie Relations, Lady and Children, that he left behind him a credit to our Country, and a copy to all sufferers for their integrity and sobriety.

               <hi>Master William Maexwell</hi> for the pannals alleadges, the pannals cannot pass to the knowledge of ane assise upon this endytment, nor no process against them upon this citatione, becaus this being ane indytment of treasone, all charges to be given to persons so indyted ought to be by a Lyon Herauld, Pursivant or Macer, and is so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by act of Parliament Jam: 6. p. 12. Cap. 125. in Anno 1492: But so it is that thirr pannals are not charged by heraulds, Pursivants or Macers, conforme to the act, and therfore are not obliedged to answer.</p>
            <p>My Lord Advocate answers to the alledgiance that it ought to be repelled as no ways relevant, becaus, the act of Parliament doth militate only in the case, when any person is charged be letters of treasone, to deliver their houses, or doe any other thing under the pain of treasone, and doeth not militat in the case of citations, and specially in this case, where the parties are imprisoned, and the dayly uncontraverted practick is opponed, their being nothing more ordinary, then the person guilty of crymes, and especialy of treasone, and being in hands and prisone for the same, should be brought to tryall, without any other formality or citatione, but giving them a dittay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sr. George Lockharte</hi> for the pannals replyes, that the defence stands relevant, notwithstanding of the answer, because, the act
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100855:8"/> of Parliament is opponed, which bears the express reasone therof to be founded, upon the importance and weightiness of the cryme of treasone, which equally militates, whether the parties accused of such crymes be in prisone yea or not, and practick and custome hes cleared the sence of the said act of Parliament for it is notour and Knowen that all indytments of treasone, before the Last act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, given to parties accused therof, albeit in prisone, yet was done by heralds and pursivants, as being the solemnity required be the said act and ther is no warrand from the act of Parliament, to restrict it to the case of chargeing for delivery of houses or the lyke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sr. George Mc. Keinzie</hi> for the pannals, says farder, that the defence stands relevant notwithstanding of the answer, seing ane indytment is a summonds and citatione, and the act of Parliament is opponed, declareing that if any other executione of treasone shall be other ways execute, the samyne shall be null, and the particle, <hi>any,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all, and therfore the act is conceived in the same termes, as if it had said expresly, that all executions of treasone not execute in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner forsaid shall be null; And <hi>Skeene</hi> does explaine the samyne in maner forsaid, Neither can the act of Parliament be restricted, to executions anent delivering of houses, seing after that parte of the act is finished, this begins with a newe distinctione and item.</p>
            <p>My Lord Advocate replyes, the former answer, and act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament opponed, being clear and express anent charges and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones under the paine of treasone, wheras the dittay and charge given to the pannals, bears no certificatione that they should appear under the paine of treasone, and cannot be subsumed, conforme to the act of Parliament, that the executione in questione is ane executione under the pain of treasone; and for the citatione, the tyme of the late Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament it cannot be obtruded, becaus such solemnity, if any was used before so high a judicatory as the Parliament, was unnecessary and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perflous, and <hi>superflua non nocent,</hi> and cannot be urged as a practick.</p>
            <p>Mr. William Maxwell for the pannals, duplyes, that the defence stands relevant, notwithstanding of the replyes, that wheras it is alleadged, that the act is only where ther is ane certificatione under the pain of treasone, bot this dittay bears no certificatione of such a pain: It is answered, that the dittay concludes the pain of treasone, so that the certificatione and conclusione are idem; And ther is no Letters for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100855:8"/> treasone, or indytment for treasone, but the pain and certificatione is treasone, and so the defence stands good from the act of Parliament; and wheras it is alleadged, that the citations before the Parliament be Heraulds, the Parliament being so supreme a judicatory, was super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous; It is answered, the Parliament being a supreme judicatory, they might the better dispense with it, and yet all these charges was by Lyon Heraulds, bot the justices in their proceedings are tyed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, conforme to the Laws of the Kingdome.</p>

               <p>My Lord Advocate answers that the former alledgiance ought to be Repelled, as most irrelevant, and haveing no ground and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione in Lawe; And as to that pretence that is acknowledged in the dittay, that the pannals and their Complices who joyned with them in the late Rebellione, did modell themselves, in Companies and Regiments and in ane army; It is most absurd to infer from that, which is lybelled as a heinous aggravatione of their presumptione and Rebellione, that they should have had the boldness, as to put or think themselvs in a capacity, to dispute by armes with their Soveraigne Lord, and Master, should be a ground of defence or extenuatione, And as to that assertione, that the Generall, and not only he bot his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior officers, and the meanest of his Souldiers, was in a capacity to grant quarters, and to secure the Lyves of Rebells and traitours; It is a most unwarrantable and illegall assertione, and with all respect to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100855:9"/> to the gentlemen that opons the same, it is answered, that it is ane alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, most derogative to his Majesties royall power and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, who only hes power to remit Crymes, and in speciall, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone, the greatest of crymes, so that either to assume, or to give and prostitute so high a prerogative, to any other persons and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to officers and common souldiers, it does reflect upon his Royall Majestie, Unless it were relevantly alleadged, that his Majestie had, be his commissione, given so high power expresly to his generall and Souldiers, to remit and secure the Lyves of traitors, which cannot be fancied much less alleadged: And as to the poynt and pretence of quarters, and that <hi>ipso facto</hi> thir persons being found in armes, got quarters and were secured as to their Lyves, even in other cases, it is not questionable; And though <hi>ex honestate</hi> it may be pretended, that in <hi>bello justo,</hi> the persons that are taken upon quarters may be spared, yet <hi>ex necessitate,</hi> there is no obligatione to that purpose, except when ane express capitulatione and <hi>deditio,</hi> and explicite pact one to that effect is expressed; but in this case, it is without all questione, where ther is not <hi>bellum justum,</hi> but <hi>perduellio,</hi> there is not <hi>hostes,</hi> bot <hi>proditores,</hi> there is not the Least shaddow of pretence for the plea of quarters, except his Majestie had expressly impowered his generall, and all under him to secure the Lyves, of rebells subdued by them.

               <p>Sr. George Lokhart for the pannals answers farder, that the forsaid reply for the pannals, found it upon the offering of quarters, and the pannals accepting of the samyne, stands relevant, and is no way elided by the forsaid answer, and that there may be no mistake of what the pannals and their procurators plead, under the terms and notione of quarters, it is condescend it that quarter, mentioned in the defences, proponed and understood in thir termes, viz that the pannals, being in armes and actuall resistance, and not in the power of the takers, did give up their armes and became in the power of the takers, upon the granting of quarter, and, that quarter so given, should in Law operate the security of the lives of the persons so taken, is evident and apparent, in suae far as it is a transactione and pactione and <hi>fides data est accepta,</hi> and accordingly fulfilled upon the parte of those who were taken, and in Law all pactions and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, being <hi>justitiae commutativae,</hi> it abstracts and does not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100855:10"/> consider the quality and merite of persons, bot the termes, fence and meaning of such pactions and transactions: And whereas its pretend it that the granters of quarters, specialy mean Soldiers, had no power to doe the same, as intrenching upon his Majesties prerogative; its answered, that it ought to be repelled, becaus what his Majesties Officers and Souldiers did act, consequently and suitably to the nature of their offices, and to the exercise of their dueties, did flow from, and was warranted by his Majesties authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so that they ought not to be contra distinguished, the authoritie of his Majesties Officers and Souldiers, being derived from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, as the fountain of the same, but specially in this case, where first before they did enter in fight, there was no discharge nor prohibitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne as to the granting of quarter, bot on the contrary, the Lievtenant Generall and all the Officers being present, were witness to the granting of quarter, and thereby the same was not acts of simple Souldiers, but acts warrand it and authorised, by the knowledge and allowance of persons haveing supreame commands: And as to that parte, that there was not <hi>bellum justum</hi> upon the parte of the pannals and their complices, it is answered, that the pannals doeth with all submissione and humility acknowledge the same, but the consequence that can be inferred thereupon, is not that quarter given should not be observed, bot that quarter might have been justly refused; and there is no doubt, bot <hi>jura belli,</hi> which doe naturally arise, without express covenant and pactione, cannot be extend it to this case, bot notwithstanding thereof, where quarter was granted in maner forsaid, it cannot be to interpret in Law or reasone, as to be a snare to any who were resisting the power of the granters justly or injustly; And its a common and known distinctione <hi>inter deditos &amp; Captos,</hi> the first being in the case of a simple surrender, which can import no more but at most a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missione upon mercie; bot is far otherways in the case of persons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And as to that pretence, that non grants quarters bot these who remits the cryme of treasone, its answered that its humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived there is a vast disparity, for in the act of remissione of either the cryme of treasone or any other, its <hi>pura oblatio,</hi> and the sole act of the granter, wheras the granting of quarters is by way of pactione and transactione, in <hi>impetu &amp; furore belli,</hi> and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatione wherof, the persons, supposeing themselvs secured, as to their lives, by quarter bacame in the power of the granters without resistance.

               <p>My Lord Advocate answers and triplyes, <hi>primo,</hi> though we were in <hi>bello</hi> as we are not, and in the case of quarter, yet the allegiance is no ways relevant as its proponed and qualified, and its not condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, what persons did give quarters to the pannals or any of them, nor in what termes, and to infer quarters and impunity from the naked takeing of the pannals, and becaus they are prisoners, its without any Law or reasone, seeing the pannals might have been overpowered and taken, and its to be presumed, that his Majesties army being more numerous and victorious, that they were overpowered and vanquished, and that they were not taken either upon ane express or ane implicite conditione or capitulatione, and the rebells being rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it cannot be thought that his Majesties Officers and Souldiers and persons of such valour, would have given quarters, upon acompt of a pretended transactione, and in order to their own safety, and that they wold owe their lives dishonorably to traitours. <hi>Secundo.</hi> The former answer is repeated, and it is most evident that we are not in the case of quarters, and though, where there is <hi>bellum,</hi> and where there is the relatione of <hi>hostes,</hi> it may be pretended that quarters ought to be observed, with abstractione from the quality of the difference of the war, whether just or injust, as when war is betwixt his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie and any his neighbour Princes and estates, though it be injust upon the parte of these enimies, quarters may and ought to be keept, yet in this case, where there is no <hi>bellum</hi> bot <hi>rebellio &amp; proditio &amp; laesio Majestatis,</hi> where there is not <hi>hostes</hi> bot <hi>praedones,</hi> such as all persons are, that are in the conditione of the pannals, who persidiously doth rise up against their Soveraigne Lord, there can be no pretence for any priviledge of <hi>jus belli</hi> and of quarters.

As to the Authority from the Lawyers mentioned in the alleadgiance, they are bot the opinions of private men, and does not amount to the authoritie of a Law, specially in this Kingdome, there being clear and express acts of Parliament, and fundamentall Lawes, that his Majesties Lieges and people should be governed and judged be his Majesties Lawes alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly, and not by the Lawes of any natione, and much less be the simple opinions and School-dictates of Lawyers; Lykas the said autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, though they were of any weight, they doe not meet nor qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate the case <hi>in questione,</hi> in respect they are only the case of <hi>bellum,</hi> as said is, or when there are express and publick transactions, be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, edicts or acts of honesty and oblivione; and <hi>Grotius,</hi> though
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100855:12"/> he might be suspect, as being the subject of ane estate who had shaken of the government of their Prince, yet he is most clear in the case, that there is no <hi>bellum</hi> betwixt <hi>subditi</hi> and their soveraigne Lord, and that <hi>resistentia subditorum</hi> is <hi>vetita omni jure,</hi> and cannot pretend to the <hi>jura</hi> and rights and priviledges of war, unless the soveraigne authoritie be pleased to condescend so far, as to capitulate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly and treate with the subjects; And its a most groundless pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that of a transactione, between the Generall, or any Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers or Officiers as to the matter of quarters, seing it cannot be said that the Generall had power, to transact be ane express capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatione betwixt him and the rebells: And it is without all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stione, that the Generall could not have secured the rebells of this army, be a transactione be himself, without express warrand from his Majestie, or from his councell, and consequently seing by a dounright and express transactione of treating, he could not secure traitours, Its <hi>gratis</hi> and without warrand asserted, that he, and much less his Officers and comon Souldiers, could be a pretended implicite transactione, secure and indemnify traitours; and it is without all questione, notwithstanding of the pretences in the contrare, that the Generall had no power to grant the said securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if his commissione had related to quarters, as it could not doe in this case, haveing to doe with rebells and traitours, and not with ane enemy, and if his commission had been express, that he should not have power to secure the rebells by quarters, bot that they should be altogether incapable of mercy, no persone could have the confidence to assert, that he would grant quarters in the case foresaid, and it is clear that we are in a stronger case, seing the Generall had no such commissione and power to grant quarters, And the Councell be their proclamatione foresaid, does declare the rebells as said is incapable of pardone, which being intimate to the Generall, and being sent to him, and intimate to all persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by proclamatione, to pleade in pretence of <hi>ignorantia</hi> or <hi>bona fides</hi> is most frivolous and unwarrantable, seing <hi>ignorantia juris ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini prodesse debet,</hi> and its their own fault, if, being ingadged and bussied in their rebellious course, they did not come to the knowledge of the said proclamatione, being founded upon the common Lawe, and the Law of the Kingdome; It being a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of both, that traitours are <hi>nulli,</hi> and no men in the constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione

                  <hi>Mr. William Maxwell</hi> for the pannals quadruplyes, that where as it is answered, that the defence is not definitely qualified, nor condescended upon the persons granters of quarters, and in what maner; It is answered, that it shall be condescended upon in write who granted the samyne, being listed Souldiers and Officers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Generall, and as for the maner, the same was in usuall forme that quarters are granted, viz assurance of their Lives from those who granted quarters: Next, where it is alleadged, that quarters cannot be presumed to have been granted, his Majesties army being victorious and the other party routed, who alleadges to have gotten quarters, its answered, that no suppositione can be admitted, against a positive defence which is offered to be proven; As for the third, whereby it is alleadged there can be no quarters sustained as Lawfull, but where the war is just, which cannot be in this case between his Majesties Generall and the rebells, It is answered, that the pannals oppons their former answer; and adds that the question is not here in the Lawfulness of the pannals quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, but whether or no his Majesties Lievtenant Generall, being constitute as a Generall, be his commissione, could give quarters or not: which the pannals mantains he had power to doe, being his Majesties Lievtenent Generall, by commissione, neither needed any such express power be insert in his commission, for giveing of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, becaus <hi>inerat</hi> in his commission, and every listed Officer and Souldier under him, he haveing the said commissione, the like po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, as any other Princes Generall and others under him hes, and to hold the contrare it seems strange, for it was never called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stione in any nation heretofore, nor did ever his Majestie or his Royall father, call in questione the quarters granted by their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Officers, or listed Souldiers under him in the fields, but esteemed the same ever sacred, to be keeped even unto these, who were in a modell of ane army of rebellione in the tyme, and if quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters should not be kept, but elided by a secondary way of pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalling
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100855:13"/> the persons receivers of the quarters, it should both intrench upon the word of the Generall his commissione, and Souldiers, to whom hereafter non may give trust, especially in a mater of sua high concernment, after their Lyves are secured to them be quarters. And as for the alleadgiance, that the Generall could not treate or assure them by a publick transactione, without the consent of his Majestie or his councell, the pannals first Leaves that to the consideratione of his Majestie and his secret Councell, giff the Generall being clade with a commissione from his Majestie, hes not power to treate, to grant quarters or receive any of those who are in rebellione to peace, where in his commissione is ample and not restrictive; The pannals answers no further, but oppones the amplitude of the commissione, the constant course observed be his Majestie, and his fathers Generalls of before, the assurance given for their Lyves by the quarter, and the dangerous consequence may insue thereupon: And where as its alleadged, that the pannals, being traitours the quarters cannot operate for them, to exime them from the tryall, and inflicting the punishment conforme to the Law of the Kingdome, since they must be ruled by the Lawes of the Kingdome, and there is no Law that can warrand their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, or exeem them from the punishment due to rebells; It is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the case now in debate is, whether quarters given to persons, modelled in ane army in the fields, giff they haveing received quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, there being no Law to discharge their Generall to give quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, if they did not Lawfully accept therof, he Lawfully grant it; for albeit the Lawes of this Kingdome rules in tyme of peace amongst all the subjects, bot in the tyme of war, where there is two armies in the fields, there the Law of armes takes place, and the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereupon the faith given in quarters is founded, most be keept, and never was broken. And as for the alledgiance, that giff the Generall had been restrained by the commissione to give quarters, the quarters given be him could not be respected, and that its alleadged the case is alyk here, there being a proclamatione emitted be the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, declareing the pannals actings to be rebellione, and that they were commanded be the same, to Lay doun their armes within a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>The Covenant and Cause being so just in themselves, and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Self-preservation and mutual Defence in maintenance thereof, being to Judicious and unbyassed men so clear, we need to say the less for vindication of our Practice: Only, the Lawes establishing Prelacy, and the Acts, Orders and Proclamations made for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance therewith, being executed against us by Military Force and Violence; And we with others, for our simple Forbearance, being Fined, Confined, Imprisoned, Exiled, Scourged, Stigmatized, Beaten, Bound as beasts, and Driven unto the mountains for our lives; And thereby hundreds of Families being beggared, several Parishes and some whole Country sides exceedingly impoverished; And all this, either Arbitrarily and without any Law, or respect had to guilt or innocency; Or Unjustly contrary to all Conscience, Justice and Reason, though under the Pretence of iniquous Laws, and without regarde had to the penalty specifyed in the Law; And all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating of Grievances (were they never so just and many) and Petitions for Redress, being restrained by Laws condemning all former Remonstrances and Petitions in the like cases; There was no other remedy left to us, but that last of necessary Self-perservation and Defence. And this being one of the greatest Principles of Nature, warranted by the Law of God, Scriptural Instances, and the consent and Practices of all Reformed Churches and Christian States abroad, and of our own famous Predecessors at home, It cannot in reason or Justice, be reputed a Crime, nor condemned as Rebellion by any humane Authority.</p>
               <p>Though we be not the first that have suffered for the Cause of God within the Land, yet we are among the first that have been Legally condemned and put to Death Expresly for taking the Covenant: And we are so far from being ashamed thereof, that we account it our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be reckoned worthy to suffer for such a Cause; And cannot but bless the Lord, that we have such a cloud of Witnesses, in this and other Reformed Churches, going before us in the same duty for Substance, and in Suffering therefore.</p>
               <p>We cannot but regrate (if we could with tears of blood) the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall and Authorized Backsliding of the Land, by Perjury and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100855:18"/> breach of Covenant; The overturning of the Work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; The great Desolation of the House of the Lord, by smiting of the Shepherds and scattering of the Flocks; The Intrusion of so many mercenary Hirelings into the Ministry, who because of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy, Perjury, Ignorance and Profanness, can neither be ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledged as God's mouth to the People in Preaching, nor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as their mouth to him in Prayer; The abounding of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Superstition, and Profanness by unheard-of Oaths, Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Uncleannesses and Drinking, even in some whose Office and Place requireth them to be more Examplary; And the sheding of the Blood of the Saints by the rage of Persecution: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot but disown all these abominable Laws, Courses &amp; Practices, &amp; declare our abhorrence of the same, &amp; dissent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from; Protesting before Angels and Men, that we be not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted as consenters thereto, and beseeching the Hearer of prayer, that we be not involved in the guilt thereof, nor partake of the plagues which follow thereupon.</p>
               <p>As this Land was happy above all Nations, for the purity and plenty of the Gospel, and for a Form of Church Government mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re conform to the Patern in the Scriptures, then in others of the Reformed Churches; So we acknowledge his great goodness to us in speciall, that gave us our lines in such pleasant places: For we have such full perswasion of the Truth of the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> And have felt so much of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Sweetness thereof, that we do here declare our firm belief and perswasion of, and adherence to the same, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government, according to the <hi>Nationall Covenant, the Solemn League and Covenant, the Confession of Faith, Catechisms Directory of worship, and Propositions for Government;</hi> Accounting it our honor and happiness to have been born in it, to have lived in Communion, with it, and now to die (through Grace) Members, Witnesses and Asserters thereof.</p>
               <p>And further as Christians and as Members of the same Church and Common-wealth; in the Fear and zeal of our God, in Love to our Brethren, in desire of the Preservation of Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and for our own Exoneration, now when we take our leave of the World, We do seriously and in the bowels of Christ, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate, Warn, Exhort and Obtest yow all the Inhabitants of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100855:18"/> Kingdom, from the King to the meanest of the Subjects, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your old Principles, Professions, Promises, Declarations, Oaths and Covenants, faithfully to Own, Maintain, preserve and Defend the said Religion; And after the example of our Noble and Renowned Ancestors to quit your selves like Men &amp; Christians, in endeavouring by all just Means, according to your Places and Powers, to shake off this heavy yoke of PRELACY, which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear, &amp; which is Destructive to all our true Interests, Religious and Civill: As ye would not involve your selves in the guilt and plagues of Perjury and Breach of Covenant; And as you tender the good of your own Names, Persons, Estates, Families and Liberties, as well as of your immortall Souls; And as ye would partake of the good of God's chosen, and of our joyes, when ye come so near Eternity as we are.</p>
               <p>We shall say no more, but as we were not afraid to take our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves in our hands, so we are not afraid to lay them down in this Cause; And as we are not ashamed of Christ because of his cross, so we would not have you offended in Christ nor discouraged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of us: For we bear you record, that we would not exchange lots with our Adversaries; nor redeem our Lives, Liberties and Fortunes, at the price of Perjury and breach of Covenant.</p>
               <p>And further we are assured, though this be the day of <hi>Iacob's</hi> trouble, that yet the Lord, when he hath accomplished the Triall of his own, and filled up the cup of his Adversaries, he will awake for judgement, plead his own Cause, avenge the quarrel of his covenant, make inquiry for blood, vindicate his People, break the arm of the wicked, and establish the just; For to him belongeth judgement and vengeance: And though our eyes shall not see it, yet we believe that the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing under his wings; &amp; that he will revive his Work, repair the breaches, build the old wastes, and raise up the desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Yea <hi>the Lord will judge his people, &amp; repent himself for his servants, when their power is gone, and there is none shut up or left: And therefore, Rejoyce, O ye Nations, with his People: For he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and he will be mercifull to his Land and People. So let thy Enemies perish O Lord, but let them that love him, be as the sun when
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100855:19"/> he goeth forth in his might.</hi> Sic subscribitur.</p>

               <head>Another Testimony which was' also left by such of the Former ten Persons, as were in the same Chamber with the forenamed <hi>Thomas Paterson</hi> Merchant in <hi>Glasgow;</hi> who, being in like manner Indited but dying of his Wounds before Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, did communicate the same to his friends, with his Assent thereunto.</head>
               <p>MEn and Brethren, being condemned by our Rulers as Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, lest we should seem to many to suffer as evill doers, in the first place, we bless and praise the Lord our God, who hath made us (the unworthiest of all men) Worthy to be faithfull to him, who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and in simplicity and godly Sincerity, singly to mind his glory; and who also maketh the cross of Christ (though by men superscribed with Treason) our sweet consolation, and his own joy our strength.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We declare in the presence of the same God, before whom we are now ready to appear, that we did not intend to Rebell against the King and his just Authority, Whom as we acknowledge for our Lawful Soveraign; so we do earnestly pray in his behalf, that God would open his eyes and Convert his heart, that he may remember his Vowes made unto God, relieve this oppressed Kirk, and long reign and flourish in righteousness.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We declare, that perceaving the Holy Covenants of our God broken, the Work of the Lord overturned, the Gospel and Kingdome of Jesus Christ despised and trampled upon, his pure Ordinances corrupted, his faithful and our soul-refreshing Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters cast out, and the Land filled with Perjury and Profanity, and like to be hurried back to that gulf of Ignorance, Superstition and Confusion, whence the Lord did so gloriously deliver us; And
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100855:19"/> finding our selves not only Spoiled of our most precious blessings, and most dear enjoyments, but urged and compelled by cruel Violence and Barbarous Persecution to wicked Apostacy from our Holy Covenants, and to Rebellion against our God; And all this done by no other hand then the wicked and perjured Prelats; And for no other ends (whatever they may pretend) then the satis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fying of their own vile lusts, and establishing their so often abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Antichristian Tyranny, over both Souls and Bodies of Men; And lastly finding former Petitions condemned as Seditious, and our private complaints (when but muttered) insolently rejected, We did in the fear and Zeal of our God, and by the warrant of his Holy Word, according to the first and most Innocent instinct of pure Nature, and the Practice of all People and Persons in the like case; And after the Example of all the oppressed Kirks of Jesus Christ, and of our Noble Ancestors, take the Sword of Necessary Self-defence, from the rage and fury of these wicked &amp; violent Men, until we might make our heavy Grievances known to his Majesty, and obtain from his Justice a satisfying remedy.</p>
               <p>We will not now mention our particular Sufferings, nor the sighs and groans of poor wasted <hi>Galloway,</hi> which though very heavy from the hand of man, are all to light for Jesus Christ; Nor are we willing to reflect upon these grivous and bitter Lawes and Edicts, by which they seem to be warranted: Only we know that God is Righteous, whose Lawes and judgments are Superior and above all the Lawes and Actions of men. And to him who will judge righteously, We intirely Commit our Cause, which is none other, then the Reviving of the Work of God and Renewing of his Covenant: Which though it pleased the Holy and Wise God, not to favour with Success in the field, and though by men it be made our Condemnation, yet (it is our Righteousness) innocency and Confidence in his sight. And all praise and thanks be unto our God, who not only kept us stedfast in his Covenant, and made us Willing and Ready to adventure our Lives for his Name; but hath also accepted and dignifyed our Offer, with this publick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; Where, in his own glorious presence before whom we shall instantly appear, and before our often Sworn and once Zealous and tender Brethren in the same Cause, and in midst of Thee O <hi>Edinbrugh,</hi> once famous for the Glory and Zeal of God and of this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100855:20"/> Covenant, we may give and Seal this our Testimony with our blood.</p>
               <p>We therefore the unworthiest of all the Faithful, do in the Spirit of God and Glory, Testify and Seal with our Blood and Lives, that both the <hi>National Covenant</hi> and <hi>Solemne League</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> are in Themselves Holy, Just, and True, and perpetually Bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, containing no other thing, then our Indispensable Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to all Duties of Religion and Righteousness, according to the revealed Will of God, which no Authority nor Power of Man, is or ever shall be able to disannul; And that our blessed Reformations both from Popery and Prelacy, and all that was done or ensued, in the sincere and upright prosecution thereof, was and is the Work of God, which though Men fight against, yet shall they never be able to prevail: And as this is our Faith, so it is our Hope to all that wait for the Salvation of God, that our God will surely appear for his own Glory, and vindicate his Cause and persecuted People, and render vengeance to his Adversaries even the vengeance of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Temple and broken Covenant. O be not then moved with our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings which are but Light and Momentany, for they Work for us a far more, execeding and Eternal vveight of Glory, and for you also a strong Confirmation and abounding Consolation, against the like trial that possibly may befal you. O then save your selves from this Wicked and Apostat Generation, and be ye stedfast, unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable, alvvays abounding in the Work and Cause of the Lord; Waiting for the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ, vvhich in his Times he shall shevv, vvho only hath Immortality, dvvelling in the Light vvhich no man can approach, vvhom no man hath seen, or can see, to vvhom be honour and Povver everlasting.

               </head>
               <p>DEar Friends and Spectators, I am brought by the good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God to this publick place of execution (vvhich is no
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100855:20"/> dishonor) for points of Treason, as is alleadged; but God knovveth (who knoweth the secrets of hearts) whether in Rebellion or not, I cam forth: He is my witness &amp; will be my Judge. And whoever they be that any way have been instrumentall or incensed against me to procure this Sentence against me, God forgive them, &amp; I forgive them. I am not now purposed to disput the matter of my being in company with these worthy Christians who are now defeat and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, their blood shed, and they despitfully mocked by many: I ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge and declare that I was with them. As to the cause of my being with them, whether in Rebellion or not God knoweth, and all <hi>Israel</hi> shall. And for me, I say the Cause is the Lords, who made the Heaven and the Earth, though now it be hated. And I desire to bear witness (with the rest of the worthy witnesses, who are gone before and are now staged) to that glorious Work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to Gospel Ordinances in their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as they have been taught and administrated these 30. Years last by past, And I adhere to the Presbyterial way of Doctrin, Worship, Discipline, and Government, by General Assemblies, Synods, Presbyteries, and Sessions, according to the Patern of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures (Jesus Christ himself being the head Corner-stone) the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith, Catechismes Shorter and Larger, Directory for Worship, National Covenant, Solemne League &amp; Covenant, &amp; every Paper tending to the good of the true Religion. And this I think fit to Testify &amp; Declare under my hand (not knowing if I shall have any Liberty to speak,) &amp; intend. God willing, to Seal with my Blood shortly. I confess that unexpectedly I am come to this place, (though sometimes I have had some small thoughts of it) and I do account my self highly honoured to be reckoned amongst the witnesses of Jesus Christ, to suffer for his Name, Truth and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se; and this day I esteem it my Glory, Garland, Crown &amp; royall dignity to fill up a part of his sufferings. And now I take my leave of you all my dear and worthy Friends and acquaintances. The Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of the Eternall God be multiplied upon yow and your seed, and upon all the suffering Friends of Christ this day; upon my dear and loving Wife, who hath been a faithful sympathizer with me, and upon my dear Children. The work of God is now at under but Christ shall carry the Day: Blessed is he that believeth and seeth not, for there shall be a performance. Now the Eternall God, who
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100855:21"/> brought again the Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, the great sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of the flock, strengthen and establish you and all the Lord's people. So pray ye, and so prayeth your Friend.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Am a man unlearned and not accustomed to speak in publick, yet being now called to witness and suffer for the Lord in publick, I cannot be altogether silent of that which Religion and Reason hath taught me anent the cause of my suffering.</p>
               <p>I bless the Lord, I suffer not as an evil doer, especially not for any Rebellion against his Majesties Lawful Authority; I attest him who is the searcher of hearts, that was never my intention in the least, and it is as litle the nature and intention of what I have done; But for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Covenant with the Lord, and following the ends the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, as to the suppressing of abjured Prelats, and Intruders upon the Lords flock, and the restoring of the Government of the House of God by Presbyteries as he himself hath appointed in his Word, with a faithful, Godly, Called, and Sent Ministery; And together with pure Ordinances, the Power of Godliness. For this I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned and to suffer this day. This I acknowledged freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Judges; This I still acknowledg, and am persuaded that herein I witness a faithful Confession. This Cause and Covenant I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to all the Lord's People. It is not free for you to forsake it; You are inviolably ingaged in it; It is not safe to desert it, because of the Curse of the perjurer and false swearer. There is unspeakable blessedness in the pursuance of it, whereof I can bear witness to the Lord by my rich Experience since we began to Do and Suffer at this time for him: Whereupon I cheerfully lay doun my Life for this his Cause; He it is who Justifieth it, what man or Authority under heaven can

                  <hi>The Testimony of Mr. ALEXANDER ROBERTSON,</hi> Preacher of the Gospel, and Probationer of the Ministry, who died at <hi>Edinbrugh,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember <hi>14. 1666.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FEaring that after the example of others, I should not be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to speak openly to the People, I thought fit (beside my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to what my brethren, who have gone before me, left behind them concerning our common Cause) to leave a word in writ for satisfaction of them who survive me.</p>
               <p>That, for preservation &amp; defence of the true Religion of this church, and for the relief of my poor brethren afflicted &amp; persecuted therefore, I joyned with others in Armes, &amp; that I renewed the <hi>Covenant,</hi> that all men might the better know my Cause and Principles, I am so far from denying or being ashamed of, that I both acknowledge and avow it as my duty; But let no man that will not condemn himself upon the same common obligations to do what I did, account me a Rebell therefore, because with the same breath that I did swear, and with that same hand that I did subscribe to preserve and defend Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, I did also swear to defend the King and his Authority.</p>
               <p>Our Church was not more glorious in her self &amp; terrible to her Adversaries, while we enjoyed pure Ordinances of Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and her beautiful Assemblies for Government and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, of the Lords own Institution, then she became of late defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Usurpation and Tyranny of Prelacy; And I do solemnly declare as a dying man, who dare not dissemble, that as I thought and still averre that the erecting of this abjured Prelacy is the cause of much of the Sin in the Land, and of all the sufferings of the Lords People therein: so I had no worse design, then the restoring of the Work of Reformation according to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the extirpation of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> to which his Ma: and all the Subjects are as much obliged as I. And let that be removed and the Work of Reformation restored, and I dare die in saying, that his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100855:24"/> Ma: shall not have in all his Dominions, more loving, loyall, pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable and faithfull Subjects, then these who for their non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance are loaded with the reproaches of <hi>Phanaticisme</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fufferings and insupportable oppression of these that could not because of the Command and Oath of God, acknowledge &amp; comply with Prelacy, may seem light to some, in whom the spirit of the old enmity that is betwixt the seed of the woman and the seed of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent remaineth, and to others (perhaps their Friends) who look the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reupon at a distance; but as there is just reason to think that if these rigid oppressions had been made known to his Ma: his justice and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency would have provided a remedy, and as the half thereof would have made the Prelats, their patrons and adherents impatiently mad, for as loyal as they pretend to be; So in the like cases of irresistible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, when there is little open door for representing of grievances and desires, and less hope of relief thereby, I suppose it will not be found condemned by the Confessions of Reformed Churches, or doctrine of sound Divines, but that it is authorized by the light and Law of Nature, by uncondemned examples in the Holy Scripture, and by the practice of all Christian States, by Armes to preserve and defend mens <hi>Lives,</hi> their <hi>Religion, Liberties</hi> and <hi>Fortunes;</hi> And espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, where they are not seeking to acquire a new <hi>Religion</hi> or new <hi>Liberties,</hi> but only to preserve their old or recover them, when they are violently &amp; unjustly spoiled of the same, as in our case; Otherwise we should sin against the generation of the just, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, as rebellious, the most of the through Reformations of the Reformed Churches abroad, and of our own at home.</p>
               <p>If this course was Lawfull, and if it was our duty to joyn therein, as I believe and lay down my life in the perswasion that it was; and if all the Kingdom was (as they are) bound by <hi>Covenant</hi> to assist and defend one another in the Common Cause of Religion and Liberty, whatever may be said of these that came not forth to help the Lord against the mighty, it cannot but be their dreadfull sin, who joyned themselves in Armes, or took Oaths to oppose. suppress and break it, seing they have sided themselves against the Lord and his Work, and their carriage is a much higher degree of Accession to the blood that is shed, then <hi>Paul's</hi> keeping of the clothes of them that stoned <hi>Siephen</hi> to death; And I wish that they may lay the matter to heart
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100855:24"/> and repent of it, that God may forgive them, as I forgive all men, and particularly <hi>Morton</hi> who did apprehend me.</p>
               <p>I know that there is a holy seed in the Land, who shall be the substance thereof, and I pray that the Lord may make them more zealous and valiant for the truth upon earth; I know also that there are many, whose bowells of compassion have been drawn forth toward these who took their lives in their hands, by Prayers to God for them and Charity to them, and especially in <hi>Edinbrugh</hi> toward the poor Prisoners (of whom I may not only say, that what they have done, deserveth to be told for a Memorial wherever the Gospel is preached, but am assuredly confident, that besides the blessings of the poor and persecuted, the Lord is not unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to forget their work and labour of love, which they have shewed towards his Name, in that they have ministred to the Saints &amp; do minister.) And yet I must needs regrate, that so many in this City once famous and honoured for harmonious owning of the Cause and Covenant of God, and blessed above many other Cities with solemn Assemblies for Worship and Government, should have been ensnared into an Oath so contradictory to the Oath of the Covenant; &amp; which was devised, contrived and imposed in lieu of the Declaration against the same, and for a Gravestone to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the revival of the Work of God within this Land.</p>
               <p>The Apostacy of this Land is very great by Perjury and breach of Covenant, and so much the worse and more aggreagable, that it is Authorized and very universal; And as I cannot but regrate that so many are insnared therein, so I must needs warne all to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hore and beware of all Declarations and Oaths contradictory to the Covenant and renounciatory thereof, as they would not involve themselves in the guilt and plagues denounced against, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily inflicted upon Perjury and breach of Covenant; and so much the rather, because this is like to be the <hi>Shibboleth</hi> and triall of the times.</p>
               <p>As for my self, I have seen and doe find so much worth in Truth, which is to be bought at any rate but sold at none, And so much transcendent excellency and amiableness in Christ, that not only with cheerfulness &amp; confidence I lay down my life for him and his Truth, committing my soul to him to be kept in hope of a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Resurrection of the body; but also bless him that gave me a life
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100855:25"/> to lose, and a body to lay down for him; And although the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket and price of Truth may appear to many very high, yet I reckon it low, and all that I have or can do, little and too little for him who gave himself for me and to me; for I account all things but loss and dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ MY LORD, for whom I now suffer the loss of all things, that I may win him, and be found in him, and that I may not only know the fellowship of his sufferings, but the power of his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and attain unto the resurrection of the dead.</p>
               <p>And as for yow, my dear Friends, as I pray for you, that the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternall glory by Christ Jesus, after ye have suffered a while, may make yow per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, stablish, strengthen and settle yow; so I recommend to you the same truth, that you be not soon shaken in mind, but that ye hold fast the profession of your faith without wavering; And as you have receaved the Lord, so walk in him; Warning and obtesting you by all manner of obligations, and by the hope and joy of that crown which I wait for, that ye keep your selves unspotted with the abominable courses and practices of these times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ye may be tempted by the extremity of suffering, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that ye beware of unlawfull Oaths and Declarations against the Cause and Covenant of God, that ye have no complyance with, nor give consent unto this Prelacy, which ye have abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; And that you be afraid and aware of Popery, which by Connivance doth so visibly abound and dayly increase; But by fighting the good fight and keeping of the faith, you may finish your course, as I do, in the assurance of the crown of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge, hath laid up and shall give unto me, and not to me only, but to all them that love his appearance.</p>

               <p>BEing made a spectacle to the World, to Angels, and to Men, I found it necessary, for vindication of the Truth &amp; of my self, for undeceaving of some, &amp; encouraging of others, to leave this line behind me, which with my innocent blood may speak when I am gone.</p>
               <p>I am condemned (I shall not say how unjustly) as a Rebell aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inst Man, but the Lord God of Gods he knoweth, &amp; all <hi>Israel</hi> shall know that it is not for Rebellion against God, but for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to recover the blessed work of Reformation, and particul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly for endeavouring to extirpate Prelacy, which hath been the cause of so much sin and suffering within this Land, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Covenant, from the obligation whereof (seing I made my Vow and Promise to the Lord) neither I my self, nor any humane Authority can absolve me. And if any account this Rebellion, I do plainly confess, that after the way which they call Heresy, I worship the God of my fathers.</p>
               <p>Although the insupportable oppression, under which I and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others did groan, were enough to justify our Preserving and Defending of our selves by Armes, yet know, that the Cause was not Ours but the Lord's; for we suffered all our grievous Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions not for evill-doing, but because we could not in conscience acknowledge, comply with and obey Prelacy, and submit unto the Ministery of Ignorant, Light and Profane men, who were ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly and violently thurst upon us; Neither did we only or mainly designe our civil Liberties, but the Liberty of the Gospel, the Extirpation of Prelacy, the Restauration of our faithful Pastors, the Suppression of Profanity, Promoving of Piety, the sawing of our s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lves from unjust violence, untill we had presented our Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and Desires; And in a word, the Recovering of the once
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100855:26"/> glorious, but now ruined Work of Reformation, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government, according to the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Covenant and Solemn League and Covenant, to which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my adherence, and through grace shall seal the same with my blood.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Advocate</hi> drew up a Supplication for me, wherein was ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledged that I had been with the <hi>Rebels;</hi> but let none offend thereat: for I do hereby declare, that I was so far from accounting that course Rebellion, that I judged and still do judge it was my duty to joyn therein, and my honor to suffer therefore; Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, I should have counted my self accessary to the blood of the Lord's People which is shed: And cannot but regrate that others of the Lord's People, when they heard of us, did not come forth with speed to help the Lord against the Mighty; much more let all mourn, that not only many have appeared as Enemies, but also conjured themselves against the Lord, &amp; the same Covenant which they so solemnly sware; And as for the Petition it self, I knew not that expression was in it.</p>
               <p>Being conscious to my self of so much weakness, &amp; so many hainous sins which predomine in me, &amp; of unfruitfulness under the Gospel and unsutable walking thereto, I confess my self the vilest of sinners, and desire to mourn for the same, and pray that the Lord for Christ's sake may freely forgive me, as I have forgiven them that have wronged me, and hope through the righteousness of Jesus Christ to obtain the same: And I do exhort all and every one of my friends to more holiness, Prayer and stedfastness, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes abounding in the Work of the Lord; And above all things, to detest &amp; shun that wicked Declaration against the Covenant; the apparant temptation of the time, and the very mark of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Prelacy.</p>
               <p>All that I have is but little, but if I had many Worlds, I would lay them all down, as now I do my life for Christ and his Cause, nothing doubting but the Lord will abundantly provide for my Wife and my six Children, whom I commit to the Lord's care, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to the Kindness and Prayers of the faithful; And do lay an express charge on my Wife that she shew all my Children, that I have bound them all to the Covenant, for which now I lay down my life, and that she lay it upon them as my last command, that they adhere to every Article thereof.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:100855:26"/>
               <p>The Work and People of God are brought very low: It may be, because they were not ripe for a deliverance; And for the greater triall, and filling up of the cup of the Adversaries; Or, because there was little, or less prayer then should have been amongst these who appeared at this time, that the Lord hath made this late breach. But, dear Friends, be not therefore tempted to call in question the Work of Reformation; or to think the worse of Christ and his Cause, because of sufferings; Nor be discouraged because these few who took their lives in their hands, fell before the Adversary; For as sufferings are often sweetned by the Spirit of God and Glory that resteth upon the sufferers, and afterward bring forth the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable fruits of righteousness unto them that are exercised thereby; So the Lord will arise in due time, and have mercy upon <hi>Zion,</hi> and plead the cause which is his own: And this Testimony, as I am this day to seal with my blood, so I subscribe with my hand.</p>

               <head>The Testimony of GEORGE CRAWFORD, <hi>Yeoman who died at</hi> Edinbrugh, <hi>Decemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 14. 1666.</head>
               <p>SEing I am to die after this manner, I lay before yow this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which I avow before God, and leave behind me to the World.</p>
               <p>That which moved me to come along with these men, was their persuasion, and my desire to help them (which with a safe conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce I could not well refuse) who, being tyrannically opprest by the Prelats and their dependants and upholders, and seing no other way was left to be taken, took up Armes for their own defence; And if this be Rebellion, I leave it to the great God the supream Judge to decern: For in my weak judgement, I found it warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table from the Word of God, and without prejudice of the King's Authority (whom I pray God to direct and guide in the right wayes of the Lord, and to make him prosper therein, so that he may be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100855:27"/> surely set in his Kingdom, having him whom no enemy can resist to defend him) seeing there was nothing intended by us, against his or any others just and Lawful Authority.</p>
               <p>But that which was my principall and chief design, was giving my poor assistance to the rooting out of Prelats &amp; Prelacy, and all such as are come into God's vine-yard without the Masters commission, these Hirelings who came not in at the true door, <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> but have climbed up some other way as thieves and robbers, whose voice the sheep know not (All which is too sadly confirmed by the dreadfull and horrid sins that are risen in the Land, and the curses and plagues that have followed thereupon) that so by taking away these, the abuses which proceed from them, and the sad consequences which follow their standing, falling with them, the Covenant of God might be re-established, and true Pastors that were silenced might be set at liberty, their mouths opened, and they themselves put to the keeping of their flocks, and all other such persons, who were banished, or any other way under suffering, relieved.</p>
               <p>And I do adhere to the way of Church Government sworn to in the Covenant, which I think and assert to be conform to God's Word; which, with His Spirit directing, is the only Patern and judge in all controversies: and however our endeavours at this time have not been successful, it is of the Lord, who will come in his own time, for he can do as well with few as with many; but it is like the cup of the Adversaries is not full: And who knoweth, but the Lord God of hosts will hiss for the bee of <hi>Egypt</hi> and the fly of <hi>Assiria,</hi> who will be more cruell and blood thirsty then we were, to avenge the quarrel of his own People, and to make way for the establishing of his own Cause. I say no more, but as I was willing to hazard my life for this Cause, so I am ready to lay it down at my Master's feet, seing he calls for it: And I pray the Almighty, to send his Spirit of Consolation promised by his Son to his own people, to strengthen them and bear them through, till the appointed time of the Lord's coming with Deliverance; for he will come for his own Cause, and for his peoples sake, and will not tarry.</p>

                     <p>BEing by a great surprisal of Providence, thus staged before the World, in a matter of so universall concernment to all that fear God and desire to be stedfast in his Covenant, I could not forbear to leave behind me this standing Testimony, concerning the Occasion and Uses thereof, for the Glory of God, for the Vindication of my Profession from the aspersions cast thereon by Men, and the Edification of these by my death, to whom I had devoted my Life in the work of the Ministery.</p>
                     <p>I have esteemed the Government of this Church by <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi> to be among the chief of the Ordinances of Jesus Christs, which by his blood he hes purchased, and ascended up on high to bestovv as a gift upon it; as being the very Gospell-Ministery in it's Simplicity and Purity from the Inventions of Men, and so the Mean by which other Ordinances are administred, and the most fundamental Truths made effectual in the hearts of his People, and therefore that it ought with that same carefulness to be contended for. Experience both of the having and wanting of it, hath given it this Epistle of Commendation, so as it may be both known and read of all men: Which is also true of the solemne Engagements of the Nation thereto, by the Nationall Covenant, and Solemn League and Covenant, which I have esteemed in their Rise &amp; Renewing, pregnant performances of that promise, <hi>Isaiah.</hi> 44.5. where it is evident, that where Church Reformations come to any maturity, they arrive at this degree of <hi>saying I am the Lords &amp; subscribing with the hand unto the Lord.</hi> So was it in the dayes of the Reforming Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and after the Restauration from the Captivity in the dayes of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah:</hi> This same promise did the Lord Jesus make <hi>Yea</hi> &amp; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to us, when he redeemed us from spirituall <hi>Babylon,</hi> which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100855:33"/> is so much the greater evidence, that these were the very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods Spirit in our first Reformers, that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly designed against the greatest motions of the Spirit of Darkness in Antichrists and his supports, and against the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test consirmations that ever these Abominations attained by the decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and that bloody Bond called, the <hi>Holy League.</hi> And therefore whatever indignity is done unto these Covenants, I do esteeme to be no less then doing despite unto the spirit of Grace in his most eminent Exerting of himself; but especially <hi>Declaring</hi> against the same as flowing from a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sedition and Rebellion, to be a Sin of the same nature with theirs, who ascribed Christ his casting out of Devils to <hi>Beelzebub;</hi> and that with this aggravation, that these <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> came never the length of professing Christ, and submiting themselves to Him and his wayes.</p>
                     <p>But we are condemned to death upon the account of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for adhereing to the dueties therein sworn to, by such as once did as much themselves as we have done, and some of them more then some of us: Which considerations have moved me to great feares of Gods wrath against the Land, according to the curse that we are bound under, if we should break that Covenant, &amp; in the fear of it many times to pour our my soul before the Lord; &amp; as soon as I heard of a Party up in Armes in behalf of the Covenant; (all other doors beings shut, whereby the redress of the manifest vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of it might be obtained, and these by manifest &amp; unheard of violence obtruded upon others) to go along with them, being bound by that Covenant against detestable Indifferency and Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality in this matter, &amp; to esteem every injury done to any ingaged in this Covenant upon account of it, as done to my self: Very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of duty urged me to this against some reluctancy of fear of what might follow. Upon the same reasons at <hi>Lanerk,</hi> with the rest I declared my adherence to the Covenant, by my lifting up of my hand, after the Articles there of were read.</p>
                     <p>And here I cannot but with greef of heart acknowledg my fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a day of trial, that being ingaged with them upon such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, I many times in fear designed to withdraw, and at length did, which as it was the occasion of my falling into the hands of the Enemy, so I think among other things it was the cause why
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100855:33"/> God delivered me into their hands. Upon the same fear, in all my Examinations I have denied my ingagement with them, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to Vindicate my self by asserting the real designes I had to part from them, and have utterly cast away the glory of a testimony, which my very being in their company as a favourer of the ends of the Covenant, and as one willing to contribute my best endeavours for the promoving of them, but especially my declaring for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, did bear unto the Truth and Ordinances of Jesus Christ against this untoward Generation: This I confesse to be no less then a denying of Jesus Christ, and a being ashamed of his Words before men; but I hope the Lord who remembreth that we are but frail dust, shall not lay it to my charg, but according to his faithfulness and Grace will forgive me, who by this Publick Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, take to my self sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If I had spent my dayes in groaning after my house from Heaven, would I have shifted so fair an occasion of being cloathed with it? Alas that I have loved my Lord and Master Jesus Christ so litle! Alas that I have done so litle service to him, that I have so litle labour to follow Me to my Everlasting rest. This I speak to these especially, with whom I have familiarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed in my Pilgrimage, that seing the Lord will not grant me Life to testify my real Reformation of these things, my aknowledgement at Death may have influence upon them, to study not only Godliness but the Power of it.</p>
                     <p>As I acknowledg that I have not been free and ingenuous in these particulars formentioned, so in other things, wherein I interponed that Holy name of God, as to the not being upon the Contrivance of this riseing in Armes, nor privy to any resolution thereanent, nor conscious of any Intelligence at home or abroad concerning it, I was
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100855:34"/> most ingenuous: And they have wronged me much, who said that I denied upon Oath, that which they were able to make out against me, or knew to be truth; But none alleage Perjury against me, but such as are so manifestly guilty of it before the World, that their tongues in such allegiances are no slander.</p>
                     <p>Although I be Judged and condemned as a Rebell amongst Men, Yet I hope even in order to this Action to be accepted as Loyal before God. Nay there can be no greater act of Loalty to the King, as the times now go, then for every man to do his utmost for the Exstirpation of that abominable plant of Prelacy, which is the bane of the Throne and of the Countrey: which if it be not done, the Throne shall never be established in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, until these wicked be removed from before it. Sure I ame these who are now condemned as Rebels against Him by them, are such as have spent much time in prayer for Him, and do more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely wish his standing, and have endeavoured it more by this late action so much condemned, then the Prelates by condemning them to death.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Disaster</hi> hath heightened greatly the Afflictions of our Chuch, and ought to teach all of you to drink the Wine of Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: Ye have not known tribulation till now; Now we Judg them happy that are fallen asleep and removed far away, and know that God hath been taking away his Servants from the Evils that were to come. Know that God's designe is to make many hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, that have been formerly too whole, and have not lamented sufficiently the removeall of his Ordinances and Ministery, and the reproach rubbed upon the Work of Reformation. Beware that your sorrow be not a momentany motion of common Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that evanisheth when it may be there is some intermission in this violent course of sheding innocent blood: Labour to have a constant impression that may sacrifice the heart, nay ye would live much in apprehension of approaching Judgment.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100855:34"/> Gods Wrath. I can say nothing concerning times to come, but this, All things shall work together for good to them that Love God, and so this present dispensation; And they shall have most comfort in this promise, who are most willing that such afflictions as we are brought to, be the way that God choiseth to work their good.</p>
                     <p>Commit wholly the management of all maters to God, and make it your intire study night and day to keep your very garments clean: It is hard in times of so generall Corruptions not to be defiled one way or other; be free of the Sin as you would be of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which will cerrainly be such as will make all the Churches Know, that God is the searcher of the hearts and trier of the reins, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.23. and so will not be mocked by these pretences whereby, men colour their going along in an evill course, from the real Love that they have to a present world. If naked <hi>Presence</hi> amongst them who are esteemed Rebels by men, be sufficient to engage them in the Crime and Punishment (for that is all the ground of my Condemnation) shall not God be much more Zealous of his own glory, against all who so much as seem to go along with this course of backsliding.</p>
                     <p>As a good Mean and encouragement, to all the duties of our time, labour to be rooted and grounded in the Love of Jesus Christ; This will be tender of any thing that may have the least reflexion upon him, His Words or Works, and will prompt the soul to Zealous appearing for Him at the greatest hazard, and to as much willingness to die for Him, as to Live that they may Glorify Him. And for the encouragement of yow all in this matter, I do declare, that ever fince the day of my coming into prison, God hath kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped my soul free from all Amazement or fear of death; that since my inditement and sentence, God hath so manifested Himself at several times, that he hath lifted up my soul above Prelats, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, &amp; Powers, Death &amp; Hell, to rejoice &amp; be glad in His Salvation; and from my soul to account him Worthy, for whom in this his Cause I should undergo the greatest shame or Paine; And to assured hopes of Eternal Communion with Him in Heaven: And that nothing hath more brangled my peace, then shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I do freely pardon all that have accession to my blood, and wish that it be not laid to the charg of this sinful Land, but that God would grant Repentance to our Rulers, that they may obtaine the same reconciliation with Him, whereof I myself do partake. Truely I beleeve many of them if not instigated by the cruel Prelats (at whose door our blood doth principally lie) would have used more mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But that reluctancy of mind to shed blood, will be so far from Vindicating of them, that upon the contrary, it will be a witness against them in the Day of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>I heartily submit my self to Death, as that which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to all men because of Sin, and to this particular way of it, as deserved by my particular Sins. I praise God for this Fatherly chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby he hath made me in part and will make me perfectly partaker of his Holiness. I glorify Him that called me forth to suffer for His Name and Ordinances, and the solemne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of the Land to Him, and thath he hath taken this way to take me away from the evill to come. The Lord bless all His Poor Afflicted groaning People that are behind.</p>
                     <p>Hereafter I will not talk with flesh and blood, nor think on the Worlds consolations: Farewell all my Friends whose company hath been refreshful to me in my Pilgrimage; I have done with the Light of the Sun and Moon.

                  <salute>Dear Friends.</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Am condemned to die I shall say little concerning men who have judged and condemned me, they are to answer to God for it; But I bless the Lord, who hath counted me worthy to die for so good and honourable a cause. And that I be not mistaken after I am gone hence, I have thought fit to testify that in singleness and sincerity of heart, I came into the service, not constrained but from conscience of my being engaged by Covenant to God, and with a full purpose to perform my vows made in that Covenant unto the Lord, in the strength of Jesus Christ; And that I might endeavour to restore again the precious Ordinances to their former purity &amp; power, and to recover the fair Church in this Land (which our blessed Lord hath purchased to Himself, and bought at so dear a rate) to her former Beauty, which is now defaced: And parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to bring down that Antichristian Prelacy, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured crue of Prelats, who have so perfidiously wronged the Interests of our blessed Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. This is the only Cause for which I undertook this service, and joyned with others my dear and Covenanted brethren; And that I had no intention to wrong the King's person or Authority, but to seek his real good, according to my duty in the Word of God, and also as I sware in the same Covenant wherein I did swear against Prelacy. And notwithstanding I be condemned of men
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100855:36"/> as a <hi>Rebel,</hi> yet I am justifyed of God, my God and Father, in and through my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who giveth me sweet peace of conscience and joy of heart: I grant it is not enough to justify me before Hin, that I had a just Cause, unless likewise I had, therewith the acceptation of my person through Faith in the Merits of Jesus Christ, who standeth in our nature in heaven, which I dare declare this day as a dying man, that I have obtained; for I am confident that through His righteousness made over unto me, He hath made me free, in which I shall stand for ever; and that within a few hours I shall see Him in peace, as I am seen of Him; and behold and wonder, and wonder and behold for evermore that most glorious excellency of His. And this yeeldeth to me great consolation in all my extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, were they never so great; This I say is my peace and consolation this day, even Christ my Righteousness, who hath both accepted my Person and Cause: Therefore I count it a small thing to be judged and condemned of men, for my Testimony is on high, and my record in heaven.</p>
               <p>And now, <hi>my Friends,</hi> I am condemned to die for adhering to my Covenant made with God, for Reformation of Religion and Conversation, to which all ranks of the Land are as well bound as I, though many (alas! too many) shaking off all fear of God have despised the Oath, not only by breaking the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but by professing and declaring avowedly the bond the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof null, and not binding either to their own or other mens consciences: And this mischief is framed by a Law, which doth greatly heighten the Sin; O! tell it not in <hi>Gath,</hi> and publish it not in <hi>Askelon.</hi> Oh! that this should be heard of amongst Papists and Pagans, that professed Reformed Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants shoulds stand in so litle aw of a solemn Oath, and Name of the great and living God.</p>
               <p>But I exhort and obtest you all, that so much the more as others have made void His Covenant yow would esteem it the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re precious, and closely follow the Reformation vowed, in every Article thereof, upon all occasion given you of the Lord; And that you abhor, detest and refuse any engagement whatsoever, that may wrong your Oath in the Covenant directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, as ye would escape the wrath of God that is coming
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100855:36"/> on such breaking of Covenant, but rather choise the greatest extremity of affliction, then the least sin of this sort; as <hi>Moses</hi> did, who refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be called the Son of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Daughter, but chused rather to suffer reproach for Christ; And be not afraid of suffering for Christ, as though it were an evill thing, neither scar ye at His cross, for the Lord Himself saith, <hi>My yoke is easy and My burthen light;</hi> Yea it is lighter to us then to many that stand by: Believe; Faith maketh all burthens light to the believing Sufferer.</p>
               <p>And now I beseech you believers in Christ, abide in Him and bring forth fruit unto Holiness, and study tenderness in all manner of conversation, and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord; And let not this profane and mocking Generation have any thing to reproach you with, but that whereof you would not be ashamed, that when you suffer ye may not suffer as evill doers, that whereas they speak evill of you, they may be ashamed that falsly accuse your good conversation in Christ. It is not knowledge nor a bare Profession that glorifieth God, but Tenderness, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and Righteousness, that do commend Religion and His Cause to all men, and shall convince your Adversaries of their Wickedness in wronging you, and make them the more inexcusable in that day when they shall be judged: Yea, what know ye, but ye may win others by your tender and good conversation?</p>
               <p>I recommend to you, that ye would be much and fervent in the use of that precious duty of Prayer, wherein most near Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God upon earth is to be found: Be much in prayer, with and for others, Forsake not the assembling of your selves together as the manner of some is (I wish they may see the evill of it who neglect it) but exhort one another, and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching: Earnestness and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence will hasten the Lord's coming with relief unto you, and to the Lords born-down Work; and your slackness in this, may make the wheels of His chariot to move the more slowly. For the effectuall fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much with God; It will do more then Armies of men and weapons of War for your defence and deliverance.</p>
               <p>I beseech you also, <hi>my dear Friends,</hi> that you acquaint yoursel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves with the Word of God in the Holy Scripture, that ye may have acquaintance with Jesus Christ who is clearly set forth
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100855:37"/> therein; that ye may know Him in His excellency and come to love and believe in Him whom ye know; that ye may be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with His revealed will therein, and may know what is truth, and cleave fast thereto, from a sure persuasion that it hath the warrant of His Word; and may be guarded against every error of the wicked, and that ye may fully know what is good and what is evill; And that ye may suffer with confidence, when ye are brought forth thereto as I am.</p>
               <p>Finally, <hi>my dear Friends,</hi> be ye perfect, be of good comfort, be of one minde, live in peace- and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</p>

And O thou my soul praise the Lord for it. I bless the Lord for evermore that ever He visited my Fathers Family, that ever He condescended to come unto my Fathers Family, and to give a visit to the like of me: He visited me there, and set his Love upon me, and hath chosen me for this very end, to be a witness for his covenanted Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For this my Soul is glad, and my Glory rejoyceth for this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour wherewith He hath honoured me; And that, though I be condemned to die by men on earth, yet am I justifyed of God
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100855:37"/> through the blood of my Saviour Jesus Christ, who standeth in our nature in Heaven, and hath made me free through his imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness made over unto me, in which I stand for ever; And within a few hours I shall see Him in peace, as I am seen of Him, and behold and wonder, and wonder, &amp; behold for evermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, even that most glorious excellency which is in Him. All that which is spoken of Him is but litle: O my Heart, my dear Love, come and see I beseech yow! I thought I had known som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of my dearest Lord before, that I had some love from and to Him before, But never was it so with me, as it hath been with me since I came within the doors of this Prison; many a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious visit hath his gracious Majesty given unto me. He is without all comparison; O love, love Him! O come to Him, O taste and see, and that shall resolve the question best. The thing I suffer for is the Covenanted Reformation. I bless God, and all that is within me doth bless and magnify His Holy Name for this, that <hi>Scotland</hi> did ever enter into a Covenant with the Lord, into a sworn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, with the hand lifted up to the Lord: And I have now sworn and renewed this Covenant again for my self &amp; you, and my four Children in all the parts and points thereof; And I pray, God help you to abide in the Covenant for ever.</p>
               <p>And now I give you and my four Children unto the Lord, and commit you to Him as your Covenanted God and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, &amp; my Childrens Covenanted Father. I say no more, but either study to be indeed a sincere Christian, &amp; a seeker of His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in sincerity, or else you will be nothing at all. I recommend you and your young-ones to Him, who is God Al-sufficient, and aboundeth in Mercy and Love to them that Love Him and keep his Covenant. The blessing of the Covenant be upon you, so fare you well.</p>

               <p>I Am come here to die, and I thank God, it is not for evill doing that I now suffer: although I be charged with Rebellion against the Kings Authority, yet I declare before God and you all, that in all this matter I never intended to wrong his Majestie's just Power and greatness, but for conscience sake did respect Authority as the Ordinance of God appointed for the punishment of evill doers, and that I wish his Ma: all welfare both in this life, and the world to come, and that it may be his happiness to consider his Obligations to God and Perform the same, that so it may be well with him and his Posterity to many generations; and I pray God make him a friend to His Cause and the truly Godly who own the same, though falsly called Phanaticks or turbulent persons.</p>
               <p>I declare I have such persuasion of the Interest of Religion Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and sworn unto in the Covenant, that I dare venture not only to lay down my own life, but if every hair of my head were a man, they should all be put to venture for this cause: I would not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve the world to stumble at the Cause, because of my death after this manner; for I rejoyce greatly in it, and I desire every good Christian as they tender their own souls that they would grip fast, lay hold on, and cleave to Jesus Christ and His way.</p>
               <p>My coming out at this time (I say) was not against his Majesty, but for the Covenant which is now troden under foot; my intention was for the Cause of Christ; I take God to witness, it was nothing else I came out for, and for that I am free to lay down my life.</p>
               <p>I bless God I am much encouraged in this, and not at all afraied to die for so good and clear a Cause; and I hope He will bring me thorow all my difficulties in this dark shadow of death: I hope I
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100855:38"/> have the peace of a good conscience, and have had some glimpses from Jesus Christ of His countenance and reconciled Face, since I came into this prison, for which I desire to bless His Name with all my soul, heart and spirit. And I rejoyce that He hes made use of me to suffer for His Cause; And I think it too litle, not only to lay down my body, but (if it were possible) even my very soul at the stake for that Cause and for Jesus Christ my good and kind Master, who hath loved me and given Himself for me. I give the Lord thanks that I had some of His Presence since I came into this condition: and again I say, I am much encouraged, and not afraied to die, and bless Him that I die not as a murtherer, or evil doer, or Rebel to Authority, but for such a cause as this.</p>
               <p>O that it were the happiness of my Nation of <hi>England,</hi> once to subiect themselves unto the sweet yoke of Christs Reformed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, under which this Nation of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath enjoyed so much of the Power and life of the Gospel, by a faithful Ministry according to the Covenant sworn by them both.</p>
               <p>And now, <hi>my dear Friends in Christ, and fellow-Covenanters,</hi> though I be a stranger in this Land, being an <hi>English-man,</hi> but tristed by providence in the prosecution of my calling, to have my residence for a time here in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which I look upon, as a singulare evidence of God's special love to me, though I be a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I say, to many of you, yet I must be bold as a dying friend, to beseech you by the mercy of God, and by your appearance before Jesus Christ, when we shall have to do with none but Him as our Judge, that ye be faithfull and stedfast in the Cause of God, and Covenant which ye have sworn with hands lifted up to the most high God, which no Power on earth can loose you from, and that ye keep you from snares unto the contrary, and not suffer your selves to fall into a detestable Neutrality and Indifferency in that Cause of God; And especially that ye keep your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves free of any Engagements by word or write, that may wrong your Oath of the Covenant. I commit my Wife and Children to His care, who careth for them that put their trust in Him before the Sons of men, not doubting but they shall be eyed with goodwill and favour by the Godly, after I am gone. And now I render up my Spirit to Him who gave it me, and for whose sake I now lay down my life. To this God,

My crime, as is alleaged, is for Disloyalty against the King's Majesty; Yet I thank God, that my appearing lately with the Lord's People was from my sense of my obligation in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the sense of the wrongs done in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This was the end of my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing for the Lord against His enemies, to bear witness against the same: The which obligation of the Oath of God, I judge that none on earth can loose the Conscience from. I bless the Lord again and again, I die for this Oath and Covenant; And I thank God also▪ that I have by the great mercy of the Almighty God in Christ Jesus, obtained mercy and forgiveness for all my transgressions both against the first and second Table of the Law: And that through that Ocean of grace which is in the Lord Jesus Christ. I believe that I am justified and sanctified, and believe now to be glorified with Him, by that blessed blood of His, which hath purchased this Salvation to me, through faith in the same, made application of, according to the good Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100855:39"/> throughout all Eternity. I die with this my Testimony, my adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the National Covenant, to the Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to the Work of Reformation a great length carried on, and now overthrown most sinfully by ungodly Men, who have esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished their Apostacy by Law, which no just Power on earth could ever do. Also I adhere to the Presbyterial Government, the Confession of Faith, Catechisms Larger and Shorter, And to the Solemn Acknowledgement of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> And Publick Testimonies thereof against the sins of the time: This day I rejoyce that He hath counted me vvorthy to lay down my life for Him, as one that beareth witness against the breach of all the Sacred Oaths and Ties that were established in this Land, yea by the just Laws both of God and Man, which never could have been repealed lawfully, as this wicked Generation hath done.</p>
               <p>Dear Friends, I hope ye will stand fast in this Obligation, and in the Solemn Oaths and Ties ye are under, and all the body of the Land also will be stedfast in the same, upon the greatest hazard ye can meet with; And that ye will study perfect holiness and nearness with God, which will help to keep you straight in this day of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution and sharp Triall that is now raging in this Land: I bless the Lord, I die not a fool, though some men have thought so of me by their speeches to me, since my imprisonment: neither durst I ever be the man to buy my liberty at such a dear rate as Perjury, and to shake off these blessed bonds I did willingly come under; And I thank God, I never yet to this moment rued or repented it; And su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re I am it is better for me to suffer the worst of deaths, then to preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve my life by breaking the Oaths of God. I also give my Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny against Prelacy and that wicked Hierarchy now established in this Land, as that which the Church of Christ could never bear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this day, it being such a grand Enemy to the purity of the Gospel, and power of Godliness, yea a yoke which the Church of God groaneth under. I have no more to say, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends all you the lovers of our Lord Jesus Christ to God Himself, and to the good word of His grace, which is able to build you up untill the day of His appearance, and to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve you all an inheritance with them that are sanctified through

               <p>I Am here condemned to die upon alleaged Rebellion against the King and his Authority, which God knoweth, I never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For in my judgement, a man's endeavouring to extirpate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Prelates and abjured Prelacy, according as he is bound by Oath in a sworn Covenant, may very well stand with a man's Loyalty to King and Countrey; for I am sure, the King and his Subjects may be happy, yea more happy in the extirpation of <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,</hi> then in their standing; Yea the Throne shall never be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in peace, untill that wicked plant be plucked up by the roots, which hath so much wasted and made desolate the Lord's Vineyard: For my part, I pray that the Lord may bless our King with bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings from Heaven, and make him a friend to the Interest of Christ, as the best way for the standing of his Throne to many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations; And I pray for all that are in Authority under his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, that the Lord may not lay to their charge the innocent blood of His Saints, which they have shed. But the ground of my sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is truly, the renewing of the Covenant with my God, and labouring to defend the same, according to my Oath: And this I profess is and was my duty, and by the grace of God will not quite it; And in token hereof, I am here before you all to lay down my life in defence of the same, and require you all to be witnesses to this my Testimony; I do declare, I am not ashamed, but count it my glory. I do likewise declare this before you all in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100855:40"/> the sight of God, the Judge of all hearts, that since the day I did first swear and subscribe this Covenant for Reformation, it hath been sweet unto me, for I am persuaded in my Conscience of the warrantableness thereof. I did swear the Covenant four ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and the last time at <hi>Lanerk,</hi> which was the sweetest time to me of them all; For with my whole soul I renewed it, and gave up both my soul and body to Him, to be at His disposal, which, I trust in God, I shall never rue. Hearty praise and thanks be to the blessed God, that ever it pleased Him to give unto this poor Church that mercy to enter in Covenant with Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that He might be unto us a Covenanted God, the richest mercy that can be bestowed on men. I have lived a Presbyterian in my judgement, according as I have sworn, and judge it to be the only way that God hath appointed in His word, for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of His Church on earth; for under that Government the power and practice of Religion hath greatly flourished, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a soul hes been converted to the Lord, and found sweet fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with Him in His Ordinances, by the Ministry of His honest and lawfully called Servants. And blessed be the day that ever I heard a faithfull sent Minister preach the Gospell. I do declare before heaven and earth that my whole designe in this Rising in Armes, was only against abjured <hi>Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi> the great Oppressors of God's Interests, and cruell persecuters of His People, both in their consciences and bodies; and I judge their Government and way not to be conforme to the Word of God in the Holy Scriptures. I might cite many Scriptures to this purpose, but I shall only name two <hi>Luke</hi> 22.26. <hi>but ye shall not be so; but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the yonger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.</hi> And 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. <hi>neither as being Lords over God's heritage, &amp;c.</hi> Yea it may be seen from sad experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, that under their Government, the power of Godliness hath decayed, and avowed profanity and Popery it self hath increased, both to the dishonor of the holy Lord, and the great grief of the hearts of the Godly. I am so persuaded of the truth of the Covenant, and of the error of their way, and that Jesus Christ is the only King and Lord over His own House, and besides Him there is none else, for He will not give His glory to another, I am so persuaded of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se things, that I dare seal the truth thereof with my blood, and am

Therefore, let all that love the Lord Jesus Christ and His Truth and Covenant, take comfort and courage, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all that which is come to pass, And let them not be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to adhere thereunto, whatsoever sufferings they meet with therein, for He will make up that loss in Himself, and avenge the wrongs done to Himself &amp; them in His own due time: I assure you, Christ is a good Master to serve: if ye knew Him rightly &amp; His cross, it is sweet &amp; easy to the believer; for He maketh death to be life, and bringeth light out of darkness. I desire to follow the blessed Captain of my salvation through well and wo. I beseech you, <hi>my dear Friends,</hi> whom now I am to part with, that ye stand to the defence of all the truths of God and of His Word; &amp; that ye receive the Lord Christ, as He hath offered Himself therein, ye who have not closed with Him; And that he who hath closed with Him, abide in Him by a lively faith and love, bringing forth fruits, that you may put credit on your profession, and keep off every thing that may shame your glorious and blessed Master be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this evill and adulterous generation. And I give you all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and exhort you heartily as ye love your own souls, and as ye will answer to Him, who shall judge the quick and dead, that ye stand fast in all the duties ye are sworn unto in the National and in the Solemn League and Covenant, both towards God, your King and one another: And that ye beware of snares in taking of any Oaths or Declarations contrary in the least, to the Oath of God in these Covenants. I leave my wife and little children upon Jesus Christ my Lord, who are now to be made a widow and fatherless for His sake, trusting, He will care for them; And I recommend them to the counsell and kindness of His people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Him. I can forgive the wrong done to me in taking away my life for this Cause, and wish God to be merciful to these
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100855:42"/> that have condemned me, or have had any hand in my death: But blessed be God, that brought and hath kept me on His side of this Cause, and honoured me to be a publick witness for Him and His blessed Truth, and Cause; for which I shall praise Him in the World to come, whether I now go: yea I will praise Him on the borders of Death &amp; Eternity. To His blessed Name, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost be praise for now and ever. So saith your dying friend for Christ.</p>

               </p>
               <p>His text was <hi>Song.</hi> 1. 7. In this Sermon taking occasion to speak of the great and many persecutions, to which the Church of God hath been and is obnoxious; and amplifying the Point from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Powers who have been instrumental therein, he said, <hi>that the Church and People of God had been persecuted, both by a Pharaoh upon the Throne, a Haman in the State, and a Iudas in the Church;</hi> and falling to inlarge the several wayes and manner of the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100855:43"/> of these men, &amp; the issue thereof; the cases of <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> appeared in the conviction of his Adversaries, to have such a near resemblance to the state and condition of the then Rulers of State and Church, that though he did make no Application, yet he was reputed to be guilty thereof.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, within a few dayes thereafter, there was a Party of Horsemen sent to the Place where he then lived near to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brugh,</hi> for to seise his Person and make him Prisoner. But upon almost no more then a moments advertisement, he escapes out of his bed, and shifting only to another chamber, was miraculously preserved from the Search then used, though most diligent and accurate. For this cause, he being necessitated to leave that Place, retired home-ward to his Fathers house, where having lurked a while, and thereafter as occasions call'd him spent the four years that have since interveend', in several places and with much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty. Yet during all this space, to the certain knowledge and sweet remembrance of all that conversed with him, he was most seriously exercised in the Study of Piety and true Knowledge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein as he greatly advanced above all his equalls, so at length he became most eminent and exemplary.</p>
               <p>While he is thus living and employed at his Fathers house, the late Troubles arising in the <hi>West</hi> fall out; and the newes thereof ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alarmed him with the rest of that Countrey, upon the 18. of <hi>Nov.</hi> last, being the Sabbath, for such motives and upon such considerations as he himself doth fully afterward declare, he joined himself to those who rose in these parts for the assisting of that poor afflicted Party, as in their consciences, by their Covenant, they thought themselves indispensably obliged.</p>
               <p>When and where he joined with them, or what was his part, or endeavours amongst them, needs not to be remembered. Only this is certain, that being of a thin body, and tender constitution, he was so disabled and weakened with the toil and fatigue of continual marching and tempestuous weather (particularly at <hi>Air,</hi> where he lay a considerable time, as if he had been dead, by reason of fainting) that he could no longer endure it. Whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, on <hi>Tuesday Novemb.</hi> 27. he was necessitated to part from them in the morning, near to the New Bridge upon <hi>Cramond</hi> water: And in his way towards <hi>Libberton</hi> Parish, about twelve
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100855:43"/> of the clock passing through <hi>Bread's Craigs,</hi> he was taken, without resistance, having only a small ordinary sword, by such of the Countreymen, as were then sent out to view the fields; in which passage it is very observable, that his escape formerly mentioned was not more miraculous, then his present taking was fatal: for it is without question, had he but retained and observed the least of that advertency and caution, wherein at other times he was known to be both ready &amp; very happy, he might, without either hazard or trouble, have escaped this inconvenience; but God who gave him the full experience of his turning all things unto the good of them that love Him, did thus by his sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and folly, prepare the way for His own Glory and His servants joy and Victory.</p>
               <p>Being brought to <hi>Edinbrugh,</hi> and first to the Towns Council-house, in their search for letters he was immediatly stript; and there being none found, committed prisoner to the Tolbuith.</p>
               <p>Upon the Wedensday, being the 28 of <hi>November</hi> by order from the Secret Council, he was brought before the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Dumfries,</hi> Lord <hi>Sinclar, Sir Robert Murray of Priest-field</hi> and others, in order to his Examination; and being interrogate concerning his joyning &amp; being with the <hi>West-land</hi> forces, he conceaving himself not obliged by any Law or Reason, to be his own Accuser, to the destruction of his life, did plainly deny the question; but being desired to signe with his hand, what he had said and they caused write, though at first he appeared willing, yet partly being advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Lord <hi>Sinclar,</hi> to beware that he subscribed nothing, whereof the contrary would be found true, lest it might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fare the worse with him, and partly scrupling at the terms of <hi>Rebells</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> wherein the question and his Answer were conceaved, and partly bethinking that a simple denyall may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port more then the pleading of <hi>Not-guilty,</hi> he refused to subscribe his name, which being reported to the Council gave great offence, and brought him under the suspition of a deep dissembler.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Thursday November</hi> 29. being again called before his Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, upon the considerations mentioned, &amp; for allaying the Councils prejudice, &amp; preventing the inconvenience he might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through sustain, he gives in a Declaration under his own hand, testifying, that he had been with the <hi>West-land</hi> Forces, with whom
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100855:44"/> he occasionally met, and that he resolved to have withdrawn from them upon the first opportunity, which he was also about to do when he was taken, without either offering to flee or resist, which he desired the Council the rather to believe, because he had told so much to <hi>William Lawry</hi> of <hi>Blackwood,</hi> a person imployed from the <hi>Lieut. Generall Dalzell</hi> to the West-land Forces. But notwithstanding that <hi>William Lawry</hi> did testify this to be a truth, yet the Council retaining former impressions, and apprehending that the presence and confronting of some other Prisoners of the <hi>Westland</hi> Forces (who plainly declared their accession to that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing) and their deponing concerning him, did only move <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Hew</hi> to this acknowledgement, although it be certainly known, that he had formed and subscribed the same the night before, they fortify and persist in their jealousy, and suspecting him to have been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver of the Insurrection, and privy to all Designes and Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce relating to it, they dealt with him with great importunity to be ingenuous, and to declare who were the Ring-leaders of the late Rising, and what correspondence either at home or abroad was kept anent it: And this was done especially upon the <hi>Monday Dec.</hi> 3. at which time also the <hi>Boots</hi> (a terrible instrument of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which the humanity of our latter times hath so much abhorred, that not only the fashion of them was forgot, but all Torture for their cause, difused; yet new ones such as they are) were laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, upon the Town Council-House table, and he certifyed, that if he would not confess, he should be tortured by them to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. And accordingly upon <hi>Tuesday</hi> Dec. 4. he was again called before the Council, where, after the Examination &amp; Torture of <hi>Iohn Nilson</hi> of <hi>Corsack,</hi> he was again examined by the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Rothess</hi> the Kings Commissioner, the <hi>Marquess</hi> of <hi>Montross,</hi> and several of the Privy Councill, (in the Town Council-House) the Bishop of <hi>St. Andrewes</hi> for the honor of his profession forsooth, and some others of the Counsellers upon more real and Christian motives, having at first withdrawn themselves: And being urged to confess, he declared, with a solemn Attestation, that he knew no more, then he had already confessed, whereupon they ordered the <hi>Executioner</hi> to put his leg into the Boot and to proceed to the Torture. But as he had before confessed and declared ingenuously all he knew, so this Torture (though in it self very violent and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100855:44"/> painful, by the extraordinary compression both of flesh, sinews and bones, by the force of timber wedges and hammer, &amp; used upon him in a double measure, even to ten or eleven strokes, with consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable intervals; as there remained no truth concealed which it could extort) did not in the least move him to express any impatience or bitterness, but having sustained it most constantly and Christianly, before he got the last three strokes, he protested solemnly in the sight of God, that he could say no more, though all the joints of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy were in as great torture as that poor leg, and desires to know what could hinder them to believe one of his Profession, who had so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemly declared as in the sight of God, that he knew no more then he had told, <hi>viz.</hi> that to the best of his knowledge, the Rising in the <hi>West</hi> was meerly occasional, upon a discontent betwixt the people in the <hi>Stewarty</hi> of <hi>Galloway</hi> &amp; <hi>Sir Iames Turner,</hi> to which every one did run, as their hearts moved them when they heard of it.</p>
               <p>This Torture was the cause why he was not indicted with the first ten, who being arraigned and sentenced on <hi>Wedensday Dec.</hi> 5. were hanged on the <hi>Fryday</hi> thereafter, at the Cross of <hi>Edinbrugh.</hi> Many thought that considering his small accession unto that Rising, which neither was nor could be proven to be more, then what he himself had freely confessed, and that he had suffered such hard measure by Torture, &amp; that not in order to the discovery of his own Crime, but the declaring of the Contrivers and his Complices, that the same should have procured him favor, but the matter was otherwise deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. Neither was the Sermon before mentioned, so quite forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, though ill remembered, and often repeated in Council in these words <hi>Achab upon the Throne,</hi> and no more, and therefore.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Monday</hi> the 10 of <hi>Dec.</hi> he and other seven receaved their Indictments of Treason, &amp; were accordingly summoned to appear before the <hi>Iustices</hi> on <hi>Wedensday</hi> Dec. 12. But his Torture &amp; close Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment thereafter (for so it was ordered) having cast him in a Fever; whereby he was utterly disenabled to make his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Tuesday</hi> Dec. 11. he gave in to the Lords of Council his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Tenor following <hi>viz. that whereas I have receaved an Indictment of Treason, which was yesterday delivered to me, and I appointed to make answer thereto to morrow, and seing in this matter of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100855:45"/> the highest importance, not only all the time allowed is very short, but I am and have been ever since my Torture in a great distemper and Fever, besides the great pain and utter inability of my leg, which hath constantly kept me bed-fast, and doth render me incapable not only of minding my own Defence, but wholly unable either to walk or stand, far less to go and compeir before the Lord Iustice, as I doubt not but Physicians will testify, if your Lo: will order them to visit me, which I humbly beg; And seing my accession to the Crimes libelled is so very slender, being only simple Presence, and that not only occasional, as I did declare before Your Lo: but also in some sort retracted, and purged, by my purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and actuall off-coming and deserting; and lastly seing I was put to sore Torture, in order to a furder discovery, with a promise of favor, in case of my Ingenuity, which I then singly used, as in the sight of God, to the utmost of my knowledge: May it therefore please Your Lordships, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously to consider the Premises, specially my utter inability to make my appearance, and to surcease any legall procedor against me, in this so weak and extream condition, and to discharge me of the foresaid Citation and Appearance. And your Lo: answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Petition and the following are therefore set down <hi>verbatim,</hi> that both the utmost of his condescendence may appear, and the fainting that he so much regrates in his last Speach, be the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. And with the same subscribed by him, there was given in, an Attestation under the hands of seven Chirurgeons, declaring his weak and sickly condition.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Council did order two Physicians, and two Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons (<hi>viz Sir Robert Cuningham, Doctor Hay, Iames Bortwick,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Kinkead.</hi>) to visit him, and to return their Attestation upon soul and conscience, betwixt and the morrow at ten of the Clock, to the <hi>Iustices.</hi>

Whereunto <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Hew</hi> being permitted to answer, began his discourse very constantly and composedly, declaring, that he looked upon himself, both from the conclusion of his Indictment, and what had happened to others, as a man appointed by men, and determined in himself to die, whereupon he thought himself obliged to use the greater ingenuity, and then affirmed, that he was not ashamed to avow that he was one of that afflicted and persecuted party and perswasion called <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> Thereafter he proceeded to speak of the Ties and Engagements that were upon the Land to God, in order thereto, and having commended the Institution, Dignity and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Presbyterial Government, he said that the last words of the National Covenant had alwayes great wei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t he was not there called in question for his perswasion, but for the crime of Rebellion, in rising in Arms against his Ma: Authority, to which he desired him to answer; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he answered, that the thing which moved him to declare himself as he had, and would have done, was that weighty and important saying of our Lord Jesus, <hi>Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of Man also confess before the Angels of God; but he that denieth me and my words before men, shall be denyed before the Angels of God.</hi> As for the Rebellion he was charged with, he said, his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession was only simple <hi>presence</hi> with a Sword, and that occasional, as his confession before the Council did bear. The <hi>Advocate</hi> answers, that not only presence, such as he was charged with, was treasonable, but all intercommuning or keeping company with <hi>Rebells,</hi> though for the space only of half an hour; and howewer, he said, he was guilty of a far deeper accession, and of many oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r things besides these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his own confession, whereupon the <hi>Advocate</hi> caused read his Confession, and also the depositions of severall others that were examined, in so far as they concerned him. <hi>M. Hew</hi> answered, that all the depositions read, contained no more then was in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, nor could they make out any more against him; and so in effect it was.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:100855:46"/>
               <p>The <hi>Advocate</hi> after the sustaining of the Indictment, having made use of, and caused read the confessions of M. <hi>Hew</hi> and the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons accused before the <hi>Assize,</hi> in place of Probation, referred the matter to their Cognition.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Assize</hi> being enclosed gave their Verdict <hi>una voce,</hi> and by the mouth of <hi>Sir William Murray</hi> of <hi>Newtown</hi> their Chancellor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him to be guilty of being with the <hi>Rebells</hi> at severall times and places, and at their Rendevouz with a Sword, according to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed confession. However it was thereafter understood, that four or five of the <hi>Assize,</hi> did with reluctancy pronounce this Verdict, thinking death too great a punishment for so slender a Guilt, and that the major part of the <hi>Assize</hi> had cleansed him, if the fear of an <hi>Assize</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> had not prevailed with them.</p>
               <p>The Verdict being reported, <hi>Doom</hi> was pronounced, decerning and adjudging him and the rest to be taken on Saturnday Decemb. 22. to the Mercate Cross of <hi>Edinbrugh,</hi> and there to be hanged on a Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet till they be dead, and that their Goods and Lands be escheated and forfeited for his Highness's use. At the hearing of which sentence, he cheerfully said, <hi>The Lord giveth life, and the Lord taketh, blessed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> And as he was carried back through the Guards to the Tolbooth, when the People made lamentation, he answered, <hi>Though men cut us off, God will receave us, trust in God, trust in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being come to his Chamber, he immediately addressed himself to God by prayer, with great enlargement of heart for himself and his fellow-prisoners condemned with him. Being afterwards asked, how his leg was, which was tortured; he answered merrily, the fear of "my Neck now maketh me forget my Leg. Thereafter he said, to another friend, <q>O how good Newes, to be within four dayes jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to enjoy the sight of Jesus Christ, and protested "he was not so cumbered how to die, as he had been sometime to preach a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</q> To some women lamenting for him, he said, <q>that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, though he was young, and in the budding of his hopes and labours in the Ministry, yet was not to be mourned for; for, said he, one drop of my blood, through the Grace of God, may make moe hearts contrite, then many years sermons might have done.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This afternoon he supplicat the Council for liberty to his Father to come &amp; visit him, which being granted, his Father the next night
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100855:47"/> came to him. Their first meeting was very sad; &amp; notwithstanding, that according both to the testimony of his Parents, and knowledge of all his relations, he was a most obedient Son; yet these inevitable infirmities which are incident to the best of men, and cannot but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish sad convictions, when considered in the power and pure light of the spiritual Law of God, did greatly trouble him in the remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the fift commandment. The passage was thus. After prayer his Father said unto him, <hi>Hugo, I called thee a goodly olive tree of fair fruits, and now a storm hath destroyed the tree and his fruits and branches.</hi> He answered, <hi>that his Fathers too good thoughts of him had afflicted him:</hi> His Father said, he was perswaded, God was visiting not his own sin, but his parents sin upon him, so that he might say, Our Fathers have sinned, and we have born their iniquity. He said also, <hi>I have sinned, thow poor sheep what hast thow done. M. Hew</hi> answered with many groans, that through coming short of keeping the fifth commandment, he had come short of the promise, that his days should be prolonged in the Land of the living, and that Gods contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy with him, was for overvaluing his children, especially himself.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Thursday</hi> the 20 of <hi>December</hi> more from the importunity of Friends, then of his own inclination, he gave in to the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> a Petition, as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That whereas upon Tuesday last I was indicted and condemned, for the treasonable deeds contained in the general and special Indictment exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited against me; in the which special Indictment, containing my whole accession to the said Crimes, there is only libelled presence in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with an ordinary sword, likeas my own confession, which is the naked truth, doth declare, how the same was occasional; And seeing that it was also in some sort purged &amp; retracted by my withdrawing and deserting with the first conveniency, whereby not only my case appears to be different from that of others, but also as favourable as possibly can be, next to innocency it self; likeas the same appeared no less to many of these Gentlemen who were upon my Assize. And seeing the Torture I sustained, and the ingenuity I then used, as in the sight of God, to the utmost of my knowledge, deserve that favour that was at that time insinuated; And that it is expected that his Majesty</hi> (whose mercy I beg) <hi>according to his great clemency and the most usual practice in the like cases, will interpose his mercy, for the rescue of many, who are equally with me involved. May it therefore please your Lordships
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100855:47"/> graciously to consider the premisses,</hi> and to pardon my great rashnes and precipitancy, <hi>and therefore to indulge such a reprival as your Lo. shall think convenient, until his Majesty's gracious pleasure anent the premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses shall be fully known; At least till the Commissioner his Grace, do return; And your Lo answer.</hi> The words marked in this Petition by a different character, were the amendments of his Friends affection, which they were advised to put in, by some members of the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> to whom the copy of it had been presented immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the downsitting of the <hi>Councill;</hi> and thereupon the Petition being transcribed, was in so great haste presented unto him, to subscribe it, that he got it not read. However the Petition was both disrelished and refused by the <hi>Council;</hi> The truth is, some of his Friends exceeding zealous of his safety, had moved to several members of the <hi>Council,</hi> that the <hi>Declaration</hi> might be tendered to him, and some time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to advise thereanent; which motion, it's like, was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with some insinuations, that probably he might be induced to subscribe it; but as the motion was ineffectual without a warrand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own hand, so even the Authors thereof do bear him witness of his positive, fixed and often declared resolution, not to subscribe it at the highest rate: Likeas, upon some surmises to the contrary, he thought it necessary for his own vindication, to leave it under his hand, that the above-mentioned resolution was from his own proper know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and motive, without the assistance of the least disswasive from any other person.</p>
               <p>During his abode in Prison, the Lord was very graciously present with him, both to sustain him against the fear of death, and to dispel all these over-cloudings of terror, unto which the frailty of flesh and blood hath sometime exposed the best of men; and also in assisting him in prayer and praises, to the admiration of all his hearers, especially on the Thursday's night Dec. 20. whereon being set a supper with his fellow-prisoners and his Father, and one or two besides, he requested his fellow prisoners, saying merrily, <hi>eat to the full, and cherish your bodies, that we may all be a fat Christsmass Pie to the Prelates.</hi> After supper in thanksgiving, he burst forth in blessing God, that had made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ords, continued saying, <hi>many crosses have come in our way and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>od then all the many that befell us before.</hi> Then lamenting the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100855:48"/> of the Church of God, with much earnestness, he used that exclamation in the last of <hi>Daniel, What Lord shall be the end of these wonders!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last night of his life, being <hi>Fryday Decemb.</hi> 21. he proponed and answered himself, several questions, to the strengthening of his fellow-prisoners, and great refreshing of all his hearers, As 1. he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; <hi>How should he, going from the Tolbooth through a multitude of gazing People and guards of Souldiers, to a Scaffold and Gibbet, overcome the impression of all these?</hi> To which he answered; <hi>By concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a deeper impression of a multitude of Angels who are also on-lookers; According to that, we are a gazing-stock to the World, Angels and Men: For the Angels rejoycing at our good confession are present to convey and carry our souls as the soul of Lazarus, unto Abraham's bosom; Not to receave them, for that is Iesus Christ's work alone, who will welcome them to Heaven Himself, with the songs of Angels and blessed Spirits; But the Angels are ministring Spirits, always ready to serve and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then all dying believers.</hi> 2. <hi>As Stephen saw the Heavens opened, and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus standing on the right hand of God, Who then said, Lord Iesus, recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve my Spirit, so</hi> (said he) <hi>do I believe, that Iesus Christ is also ready to receave the souls of his dying sufferers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He enquired, <hi>What is the way for us to conceave of Heaven who are hasting unto it,</hi> seing the Word saith, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him? Whereunto he answered, <q>that the Scripture helps us two wayes to conceave of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The first is by way of similitudes, as in that Rev. 21. where heaven is held forth, by the representation of a glorious City, there described; but in the same place it is also termed the Bride; but O how unlike are these two, a Bride and a City! which doth clearly eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the insufficiency and vast disproportion of all such similitudes;</q> and therefore he addeth, <q>the Scripture furnisheth yet a more excellent way to conceave of heaven; and that is 1. by conceaving the love of Christ to us, even what is the breadth and length and depth and height and the immenseness of that love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, which is also the highest and sweetest motive of praise; unto him, that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever, Amen.</q>
                  <q>2. By
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100855:48"/> holding forth the love of the Saints to Jesus Christ, and teaching of us to love him in sincerity, which is the very joy and exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heaven, Rev. 5.12.</q> Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receave power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing. <q>And no other thing then the soul breathing forth love to Jesus Christ, can rightly apprehend the joyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The last words which he spoke at supper, were in the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Love</hi> above <hi>knowledge,</hi> saying, <q>O but notions of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge without Love, are of small worth, evanishing in nothing, and very dangerous.</q> After supper, his father having given thanks, he read the 16 Psalm, and his first words thereafter were, <q>If there were any thing in the World sadly and unwillingly to be left, it were the reading of the Scriptures.</q> I said I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord, in the land of the living, <q>but this needs not make us sad; for where we go, the Lamb is the book of Scripture, and the light of that City, and there is life, even the river of the water of life, and living springs.</q> To this he added many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent observations, and making mention of the 23 v. of the 31 Psal. O love the Lord, all ye his saints, he added, <q>that where love was, it was so operative, that it made flesh, spirit; and where it was not, there spirit was made flesh: thereafter he sung a part of the Psalm.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Supper being ended, he cals smileingly for a pen, saying, <hi>it was to write his Testament,</hi> wherein he only ordered some few books, which he had, to be redelivered to several persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He went to bed a litle after eleven of the clock, and having slept wel till 5 in the morning, he arose and called to his Camerade <hi>Iohn Wodrow,</hi> saying pleasantly, <hi>up Iohn;</hi> for you are too long in bed; you and I look not like men going this day to be hanged, seeing we lye so long.</q> Thereafter he said to him in the words of <hi>Isaiah ch.</hi> 42. <hi>v.</hi> 24. Who gave <hi>Iacob</hi> for a spoil, and <hi>Israel</hi> to the robbers? did not the Lord? he against whom we have sinned, for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto His Law, &amp;c. <q>and I think, <hi>Iohn,</hi> (said he) I have not known it, nor do I lay it to heart, as it is said in the end of the 25 verse. But, <hi>Iohn</hi> (said he) for all this be not affraid, but read the 43. ch. v. 1. 2. for all will go well with us.</q>
                  <hi>Iohn,</hi> said to him, <q>you and I will
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100855:49"/> be chambered shortly in heaven, beside <hi>Mr. Robertson.</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, "I fear, <hi>Iohn,</hi> you bar me out, because you was more free before the Council then I was; but I shall be as free as any of you upon the Scaffold. Before break-fast, he said, he had got a clear ray of the Majesty of the Lord after his awaking, but it was a litle again over-clouded. Thereafter he prayed, "and attested the Lord, that he had devoted himself to the service of God in the Ministry of the Lord Jesus, and the edification of souls, very early; adding albeit I have not been so with my God, yet thow hast made with me an Everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure; this is all my desire, joy and salvation, albeit thow make me not a house to grow. Now Lord, we come to thy thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, a place we have not been accquainted with; earthly Kings thrones have Advocats against poor men, but thy Throne hath Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, an Advocate for us. Our supplication this day, is not to be free of death, nor of pain in death, but that we may witness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many witnesses, a good confession.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His Father coming to him that morning to bid him farewel, his last words to him were, after prayer and a litle discourse, <q>that his suffering would do more hurt to the Prelates, and be more edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to God's people then if he were to continue in the Ministry, for twenty years.</q> And then he desired his Father to leave him, else he would but trouble him, <q>&amp; I desire it of you, said he, As the best and last service you can do me, to go to your chamber, and pray earnestly to the Lord to be with me on that Scaffold: for how to carry there is my care, even that I may be strengthened to endure to the end.</q>
               </p>
               <p>About two of the clock in the Afternoon, he was carried to the Scaffold with other five that suffered with him; where he appeared to the conviction of all that formerly knew him, with a fairer, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more stayed countenance then ever they had before obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Being come to the foot of the Ladder, he directed his speech North-ward to the multitude. And premising, <hi>That as his Years in the World had been but few, so his Words at that time should not be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> He spoke to the People, the speech and Testimony which he had before written and subscribed.</p>
               <p>Having done speaking to the People, who heard him with great attention, he sung a part of the 31 Psal. and then prayed with such
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100855:49"/> power and fervency, as forced many to weep bitterly. Having ended he gives his cloak and hat from him; And when he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himself and took hold of the Ladder to go up, he said with an audible voice, <hi>I care no more to go up this Ladder and over it, then if I were going home to my Fathers House;</hi> And as he went up, hearing a great noise amongst the People, he called down to his fellow-sufferers, saying, <hi>Friends and Fellow-sufferers, be not affraid, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry step of this Ladder is a degree nearer Heaven.</hi> Then having seated himself thereon, he said, <hi>I do partly believe, that the Nobles, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, and Rulers of the Land, would have used some mitigation of this punishment, had they not been instigated by the Prelates, so our blood lyes principally at the Prelats door. But this is my comfort now, that I know my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth, and though after my skin, worms destroy this Body, yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for my self, and mine Eyes shall behold</hi> (pointing to his eyes) <hi>and not another, though my reins be consumed in me. And now I do willingly lay down my life for the Truth and Cause of God, the Covenants and Work of Reformation, which were once counted the Glory of this Nation. And it is for endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to defend this, and to extirpate that bitter root of Prelacy, that I embrace this rope</hi> (the Executioner putting the rope about his neck.) Then hearing the People weep, he said, <hi>Your work is not to weep, but to pray that we may be honourably born through; and blessed be the Lord, that supports me. Now as I have been beholden to the prayers and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of many since my imprisonment and sentence; So I hope you will not be wanting to me now, in this last step of my journey, that I may witness a good Confession: And that you may know the ground of my encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Work, and what my hope is, I will read to you the last Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Bible;</hi> And having read it, he said, <hi>Here you see the Glory that is to be revealed upon me, a pure river of water of life, and so forth</hi> (read the place) <hi>where the Throne of God is, and the Lamb is in it, where his Servants serve Him and see His face, and His Name is in their foreheads, and the Lord God giveth them light, and they shall reign for ever and ever; and here you see my access to my Glory and reward.</hi> Let him that is a thirst come, and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely. <hi>And here you see also my welcome,</hi> the Spirit and the Bride say, Come. Then he said, <hi>I have one word more to say to my Friends,</hi> (looking down to the Scaffold) <hi>where are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100855:50"/> you? You need neither lament me nor be ashamed of me in this condition, for I may make use of that expression of Christs, I go to your Father and my Father, to your God and my God, to your King and my King, to the blessed Apostles and Martyrs, and to the City of the Living God, the heavenly Ierusalem, to an innumerable company of Angels, to the General Assembly and Church of the First-born, and to God the Iudge of all, and to the Spirits of just men made perfect, and to Iesus the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the new Covenant; And so I bid you all farewell: For God will be more confortable to you then I could be; And he will also now be more refreshing to me, then you can be: farewel, farewel in the Lord.</hi> Then the Napkin being put on his face, he prayed a space within himself, after which he put up the cloath from his face, with his own hand, and said, he had one word more to say, and that was to shew them the comfort he had in his Death, saying, <hi>I hope you perceaved no alteration or discouragement in my countenance and carriage, and as it may be your wonder, so I profess it is a wonder to my self, and I will tell yow the reason of it: Besides the justness of my Cause, this is my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which was said of</hi> Lazarus <hi>when he dyed, that the Angels did carry his soul into</hi> Abraham's <hi>Bosom; so, that as there is a great solemnity here, of a confluence of People, a Scaffold, a Gallows, and People looking out at windows; so is there greater &amp; more solemn preparation in Heaven, of Angels to carry my soul to Christs' bosom. Again, this is my comfort, that it is to come in Christ's hands, and He will present it blameless and faultless to the Father, and then shall I be ever with the Lord. And now I leave of to speak any more to creatures, and turn my speech to thee. O Lord! and now I begin my entercourse with God, which shall never be broken off. Farewel Father and Mother, Friends and Relations; Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel the World and all Delights, Farewell meat and drink, Farewel Sun, Moon and Stars; Welcome God and Father, Welcome sweet Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, the Mediator of the new Covenant, Welcome blessed Spirit of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and God of all consolation, Welcome Glory, Welcome Eternal Life, Welcome Death.</hi> Then he desired the Executioner not to turn him over, untill he should put over his own shoulders himself, which, after praying a little within himself, he did, saying, <hi>O Lord! into thy hands I commit my Spirit: for thou hast redeemed my Soul, Lord God of truth.</hi> Thus in the 26 Year of his age, he died, as he lived, in the Lord.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100855:57"/> Council and sessione anent the case forsaid, with their advice and answer given thereto, whereof <hi>the tenor follows:</hi> Whither or not a persone guilty of high treasone, may be pursued against, before the justices, albeit they be absent and contumacious, so that the Justice upon citatione, and sufficient probatione and evidence, may pronounce sentence and doom of forfaultur, if the dittay be proven. The reasone of the Scrupill is, that process of forfaulture are not so frequent, and that in other ordinary crymes, the defendars; if they doe not appeare, are <hi>declared fugitives,</hi> and that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing reasones, appear to be strong and relevant for the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; <hi>primo</hi> by the common Law, albeit a partie absent cannot be condemned for a cryme, yet in treason, which is <hi>crimen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum,</hi> this is a speciality, that absents may be proceeded against and sentenced. <hi>Secundo</hi> by <hi>the first act of King James the fift his sixt Parliament,</hi> it is declared, that the King hes good cause, and actione to pursue all somounds of treasone, committed against his persone and Common-wealth conform to the Common Law, and good equitie and reason, notwithstanding there be no Speciall Law, act or provisione made thereupon: And therefor seeing be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, persones guilty of <hi>laese Majestie,</hi> may be proceeded against and sentenced, though they be absent; it appears that there is the same reason, that the justices should proceed against, and sentence persones guilty of treason, though absent, and that he is sufficiently warranted by the said act of Parliament Swa to doe. <hi>Tertio,</hi> it is inconsistent with Law, reason and equitie, that a persone guiltie of treason, should be in a better case, and his Majestie in worse, by the contumacy of an traitor, the samen being an additione, if any can be to so high a cryme, and that he should have impunitie, and his Majestie prejudged of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualitie, and benefite arysing to him by his forfaulture. <hi>Quarto,</hi> The Parliament is in use to proceed and pronounce <hi>forfaultur,</hi> though the partie be absent, and in so doing, they doe not proceed in and by a <hi>legislative</hi> way, Bot as the supreme judges, and the Parliament being the fountaine of justice, what is just befor them, is just and Warrantable, before other judicatories in the lyke cases. <hi>Quinto</hi> be the aboue-mentioned act of Parliament, it is statute, <hi>that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounds and process of treasone</hi> may be intented and pursued, after the decease of the delinquent, against his memory and estate, for
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100855:58"/> dilating the one and forfaulting the other, whereupon sentence may follow to the effect foresaid; and therefor, seeing sentence may follow where the delinquent cannot be present, and is not in being, It were against all reason, that when they are willfully and contumaciously absent, they should not be proceeded against, and sentenced if they be guiltie: And it were most unjust, that his Majestie should be necessitat to <hi>call a Parliament,</hi> for punishing and forfaulting of persones being absent, or that he should wait untill they die, specially seeing in the <hi>interim</hi> the probatione may perish, be the death of the wittness.</p>
